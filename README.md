# mordheim

Code in this repository is a decompile of Assembly-CSharp.dll of the game Mordheim: City of the Damned. As such all in the master branch is © Rogue Factor and any Warhammer related content in the code is © Games Workshop.

The intent of this repository is unofficial modding of the Mordheim: City of the Damned game, as Rogue Factor has stopped development, and while the game is great it has many bugs and flaws that need addressing.

The master branch will only ever contain a decompile of the final release of the game (1.4.4.4). All modding will be done in branches. Code in this branches indicate a difference from the original final release of the game and are only intended to be compiled into the DLL by use of dnSpy. None of the code in this repository can be separatly compiled at this point, as it contains many errors due to compiler generated variables and such.
