Warriors drawn into the service of Reikland are held to a high standard of professionalism, eschewing the flamboyance of other provinces. For a Reiklander, sturdy armour and a reliable sword are more precious than silks and jewelled vestments. Grand Prince Siegfried of Reikland claims the vacant Imperial throne for himself, and the warriors of his land will do their utmost to see him crowned Emperor. Even if they aren’t above making some coin for themselves in the process. A Reiklander is always pragmatic.",
    "801031360" : "Mordheim has become a lawless, blighted place, far from the authority of temples and noble lords. The malignant clutch of Chaos hangs heavy over the ruins, changing those too desperate or too stubborn to leave, drawing to it creatures already twisted by mutation and corruption. Groups of these degenerates and mutants gather together into the Cults of the Possessed, seeking to gain the favour of the Shadowlord by returning the wyrdstone to the Pit and slaughtering all those they find trespassing upon their master’s domain – the City of the Damned. The inhuman, the subhuman and the nonhuman all gathered into the dark embrace of madness.",
    "2461400830" : "The Rock lies in the middle of the River Stir in the southern part of Mordheim. More fortress than convent, the Rock has survived the devastation wrought by the comet and provided a refuge for the Sisters of Sigmar. Branded witches and worse by the broader Cult of Sigmar because of their miraculous deliverance, the Sisters maintain a fervent devotion to their god. They seek to prove themselves and redeem their order by cleansing Mordheim of the many evils that beset it and locking away the tainted wyrdstone where its corruption cannot spread. Armed with faith and warhammer, the Sisters stand ready to oppose all who would defy them.",
    "804019986" : "The Skaven of Clan Eshin are accomplished masters of stealth and murder. Long ago they learned the art of assassination in distant lands. Now they are among the most feared of the Great Clans of the Under-Empire. These silent killers serve as the eyes and ears of Skavendom, infiltrating the realms of other races and spying upon them from the shadows. Striking from ambush, utterly without mercy and honour, endowed with a ferocious speed and viciousness far in excess of any human, the Skaven are hideous foes. The chance to increase their own prestige inside the clan makes the warbands infesting Mordheim even more ruthless – and dangerous.",
    "2326030526" : "The vassals of Count Vlad von Carstein include both the living and the undead, for the vampire lord knows the utility of mortals and the weaknesses of his own kind. Whether living or dead, all are his servants, sworn to the Master's will. While the courts of Altdorf, Middenheim and Marienburg all squabble over the Emperor's crown, few suspect that the tyrant of Sylvania has his own designs. The warbands who have journeyed to Mordheim are sent to gather wyrdstone that the dark magic bound into the shards can be harnessed and used to create more undead. They are both cunning and ruthless, for any foe that falls to their blades may rise again to serve Sylvania.",
    "1717557926" : "The Order of the Templars of Sigmar was founded in the early days of the Empire. Commonly known as Witch Hunters, these warriors root out evil where it hides among men. Depraved Chaos cults, hideous mutants, the abominable undead, witches and sorcerers practicing their black arts, even the insidious Skaven have been unmasked and destroyed by the zealous efforts of Witch Hunters. To join the Order is to accept a violent and dangerous life. Fear and mercy alike are qualities no Witch Hunter can allow within himself, only unwavering faith in Sigmar. These warriors have come to Mordheim to redeem it from its corruption – or see it purged in fire.",

    "2519188936" : "Not since the horrors of the Black Plague has our land seen such despair. Almost two millennia after Sigmar founded the Empire, the realm is fractured and broken. Three rival factions claim the Imperial crown: Marienburg, Middenheim and Reikland. An ever-shifting maze of alliances and treaties binds the other provinces to one of these three ‘Emperors’. Territorial ambitions and the lure of power bring the armies of men against one another in a seemingly endless tide of skirmish and battle.",
    "2569521793" : "Among the most prosperous of the great cities in these troubled times was Mordheim. Count Steinhardt, through craft and guile, was able to keep himself neutral in the rivalries of the Imperial claimants. An island of peace in a sea of conflict, Mordheim drew wealth such as the city had never seen into its walls. Rich merchants and powerful nobles flocked to the safety of the city. It grew even grander than before, but with its prosperity came the corruption of arrogance and hedonism and greed.",
    "2552744174" : "The gods could not long abide the outrages of Mordheim’s populace. In the heavens, an ill star appeared, a great twin-tailed comet that some priests warned was nothing less than the Hammer of Sigmar. They preached tidings of doom and repentance, but their sermons were ignored. An attitude of rebellious revelry gripped the city as the comet grew ever nearer. The grand festival to celebrate the turn of the year was a mockery of the apocalyptic prophecies. It was then that the Hammer fell.",
    "2603077031" : "The splendour of Mordheim was obliterated in an instant. The fiery comet ploughed through the city, gouging a deep crater in the midst of the Poor Quarter. The impact, however, wrought ruin throughout. The wondrous palace of Count Steinhardt was broken, the grand Amphitheatre shattered, the Great Library blighted by a pall of ash. Fire and smoke decimated the populace but worse awaited the survivors. A malignant corruption that brought with it mutation and madness. The vile taint of Chaos.",
    "2586299412" : "In the shattered city, strange green-black stones were discovered. The wise determined them to be fragments of the comet that had smashed into Mordheim. Strange energies emanated from these shards and at times the stones even appeared to glow with magical power. Warlocks and alchemists experimented with these ‘wyrdstones’ and soon determined that their uncanny properties could work wonders. Wyrdstone could heal the sick, cause a dead field to produce crops, rejuvenate the old or even turn base metal to gold.",
    "2636632269" : "Lust for wyrdstone focused avaricious eyes upon Mordheim. Treasure hunters descended upon the city, vying with mutated horrors that claimed the ruins, crusading zealots who sought to prevent the taint from spreading, and inhuman creatures staking their own claims.

The witch practicing her fell magic, the mutant spreading its corruption of flesh, the necromancer violating the sanctity of the grave, the daemon seeking to possess souls – these are the foes of the Witch Hunter. The Witch Hunters will allow nothing to make them waver in their defence of mankind against these evils. They are the Templars of Sigmar, and with sword and fire they will return their god’s justice to Mordheim.",

They are determined to visit the wrath of Sigmar upon the heretics and monsters that now crawl through the ruins.

Among the most powerful of the clans is Clan Eshin, feared assassins and killers. Cloaked in black, the eyes and ears of Clan Eshin are everywhere.

From the ancient castle of Drakenhof, Count Vlad von Carstein rules the county, but his ambition drives him to seek greater power. With the Empire consumed by civil strife, Vlad sees opportunity.

    "4177121492" : "So, you’ve decided to brave the City of the Damned in search of gold and glory? There’s no shortage of those who’ve tried before you. If you look hard enough, you’ll find their bones littering the ruins. Mordheim doesn’t forgive mistakes, so you’d better not make any. I’ll say this for you: you’ve taken the first step to surviving. You had the good sense to seek out Luthor Wolfenbaum. I’ve forgotten more about this city than you’ll ever learn. Listen to me and you just might leave this place with the fame and fortune you’re after.

I’m not sure what oaths and vows bind you to Baron von Leitdorfer’s service. I’m not really interested in the Imperial pretensions of Reikland’s Grand Prince either. You need to concentrate on one thing only and that’s the task immediately before you. Aye, there’s wyrdstone in the ruins, ready for the taking. But there’s other things in the ruins too. You’ve got those murdering maniacs from the Rock, ready to kill anyone they find with even the smallest shard on them. They’re bad, but even worse are the degenerates who’ve taken to worshipping the comet that smashed Mordheim. They’re twisted in both mind and body and will happily dump your body into the Pit as an offering to their Shadowlord. You’ll even see things you wouldn’t believe prowling the ruins: the verminous underfolk, the skaven of legend, are quite real, I assure you. They’ll steal your wyrdstone and gnaw your bones given half the chance. 

Aye, the dangers are great, but if you were cowardly you’d never have made the journey here. There’s treasure to be had, if you’re bold and ruthless enough to claim it. This city chews up the timid and the weak, so remember that and keep your men strong. Do that and you might just survive.",

That is good. That is as it should be. Many are consumed by the power of Chaos. It is only the select few who aspire to understand.

You may call me Merga. I came to this place on behalf of the Purple Hand to discover the Change that had been visited upon Mordheim. Do not listen to the Sigmarite fools, it was no judgement of their puny god that descended upon this city. It was the blessing of the Dark Gods we serve! They see only destruction, their minds yearning for what was and refusing to accept what is. We know better, we see not corruption but liberation in the touch of our gods. What is Chaos if not freedom? Freedom from the tyrannies of flesh and form, of spirit and soul! Escape from the lies we have been told to accept as reality!

Since coming here, I have heard the whispers of the Shadowlord. I have felt his glory surround me until my body was wrapped in his darkness. Behold the Change worked upon me. Gaze upon the might of the Dweller in the Pit! Beside him, even the Purple Hand are but blind children!

You have heard the Shadowlord’s call. You have cast aside the chains of morality and mercy, cut all the weakness of doubt from your mind. A greater calling beckons you – to serve the Ruinous Powers. Gather the wyrdstone, return its darkness to the Pit. By its malefic energies, shall the Shadowlord grow strong. Kill all those who would dare oppose you! Let them be offerings to Old Night! Glory and horror await you, the wonders and terrors of real truth! Of Chaos!",
    "3573220185" : "In the name of Most Holy Sigmar, I greet you, Sister. Your service and dedication to our order has long been in my mind. As High Matriarch, I must put your conviction and valour to the ultimate test. Hold fast to your faith, keep Sigmar’s glory in your heart, remember the tenets of your devotion, and I know you will acquit yourself as a Matriarch should.

Well do you know the calamity that visited judgement upon this city. The Hammer of Sigmar descended from the heavens to strike down the wickedness of this place. The Rock alone was spared, our tiny bastion of piety within the decadence of Mordheim. Yet in maintaining our own purity, did we not forsake our duty to the people around us? Did we not become frustrated and abandon them to their wantonness? In that, we wronged Sigmar and for that crime our order must be redeemed. The Cult of Sigmar has branded us heretics and worse. We must prove to them, prove to the Grand Theogonist himself, that our faith has not been tainted.

Only by cleansing the corruption from Mordheim, atoning for our earlier failures, can we be restored. It is a dangerous duty I must entrust to you, to lead a warband of our Sisters into the ruins and gather the corrupt wyrdstone. If Mordheim is to be purged, then the taint must be locked away where it can work no further harm. There are many who covet the foul stones, both human and inhuman. You must persecute them all with the zeal of Holy Sigmar, you can’t allow mercy to temper your purpose. Let nothing cause you to falter in this sacred duty.

Among his subjects, living and undead, it is you who have been entrusted with this important task. I wonder if you appreciate the enormity of the task ahead of you. The master expects much from you.

I can sense your suspicion of me. It is true that I once served Queen Neferata, but it is in the halls of Drakenhof that my loyalty is now bound. Do you see this ring? It is Count Vlad's token, his sign that Baroness Katherina von Dernsbach is his vassal and agent. Beware, for I am his eyes and ears in Mordheim. What I learn, the master will know.

Look upon the ruin of Mordheim. The mortals fear this desolation, only the bold or desperate come here to scavenge and steal, only the most fanatical come here to claim this devastation for their gods. The earth, the waters, even the very air have become tainted by the dark energies that have wrought this destruction. Nothing that lives can linger here long without being transformed in either flesh or spirit.

Such concerns matter little to us. Our magic will sustain us against the malignity of the ruins. For the danger is little when set against the reward. The power that lies scattered about Mordheim offers a key to feats of necromancy not dared since Great Nagash walked the land. Littered about the ruins are the wyrdstone shards, vessels of incredible arcane energies. In the hands of Count Vlad, these shards will transform the world, tearing down the fractious realms of men.

Your duty is clear. Find the wyrdstone and you will have a share in Count Vlad's mighty ambition. Fail him and I promise you will find there is no escape from his rage even in the grave.",
    "3492336957" : "Gaze upon this blighted place, my brother! Has such abomination ever been visited upon Sigmar’s glorious Empire before? Well can I understand those who would harken to the claim that we are being punished for straying from His light.

Forgive me, brother, I forget to introduce myself. I am High Capitular Wilhelm Krieger. Long has my family sent its sons to serve the Order of the Silver Hammer, but I felt called to a different path and took the oaths of the Order of the Anvil. The ways of our god are many, however, and here I am fighting beside you all the same. For what man of courage and conscience could sit idle in Wolfenburg Cathedral when our Grand Theogonist has proclaimed Sigmar’s punishment upon Mordheim?

The City of the Damned, for such this place has become, draws all that is evil to it. Here the taint of Chaos has gone to ground. Abominable Cults of the Possessed have risen, flocking to these ruins to celebrate the depravity that has consumed their souls. The vile underfolk – the loathsome skaven – slink through the desolation. The heretical Sisters of Sigmar cloak their iniquities in the name of our god. Opportunistic mercenaries loot the rubble, searching for shards from the Hammer of Sigmar. It is that theft which alarms the Grand Theogonist most.

Our duty here is twofold. The evils that infest Mordheim must be purged by sword and flame. The wyrdstone shards from the comet must be recovered. Only Sigmar’s temple has the wisdom to safely harness the powers of the shards, only we have rightful claim to them. The wealth the wyrdstone can bring to the Temple will make us strong enough to bring an end to the division that racks the Empire and unite mankind once more under a single ruler. 

All glory to Mighty Sigmar that He has chosen us for this sacred duty!",

Naturally the prospect of furthering his own position while diminishing the Duke’s is very appealing to your patron. His command is simple: find the knight and get him out of Mordheim.

He will be throwing a large feast in celebration of the Baroness’s birthday, with most of the province’s noble houses attending the event.

This state of affairs is one that the Shadowlord will no longer abide. The demands from the Pit are simple – defile the temple and drag it down into the darkness that has claimed Mordheim. Through this desecration, the temple will be blighted, never to be redeemed.",

This sword had bound into it mighty enchantments that made it particularly potent against the creatures of Chaos. The very existence of this weapon is a threat to the Shadowlord’s minions.

If the Lord of the Pit is aware of her deception, he has yet to make his displeasure known. Instead, Merga has received another vision from the Shadowlord, the image of a skaven chieftain of such villainy and wickedness that his lifeblood will make a perfect offering to her master. Hunting down this creature is the next task the Shadowlord demands be performed by his favoured servants. There is reward to be had in serving the Shadowlord and worse than death for those who defy him.",

The only clue to her disappearance are the unsettling dreams suffered by the Sisterhood’s other augurs the night before she was discovered missing.

Returning such a relic to the Sigmarites will gain him great favour in their eyes, perhaps even the support of an Arch-Lector or the Grand Theogonist himself! Such an endorsement from Sigmar’s priesthood is something more valuable than gold or wyrdstone. Supported by the priests, the Baron will have far greater legitimacy than his rivals and his enemies will have to think carefully before interfering in his affairs lest they bring the wrath of Sigmar down upon their heads.

“Make no mistake, the Baron will be greatly pleased with what you have accomplished this day. I do not think you will go unrewarded.

“For now, however, we must leave this place. The profane hate of the corrupt draws them to the ruined temple like moths to flame. Much as it pains me to do so, we cannot linger. We do not have the strength or the time to protect this place from all those who would defile it. I would not shed more blood for a hopeless cause, even one fought in the name of Lord Sigmar.”",
    "4036981543" : "“The Curator is gone, but I fear this place will forever be fouled by the daemonic things he conjured to protect his books. Even now I can feel unseen things watching me, scratching at the invisible wall that keeps them from this mortal world. I do not want to be here when they slip through that fence. In the face of such malignant forces, simple warriors like us are powerless. All we can do is leave while we can and trust that the daemons can’t stray too far from this blighted place.

“Our good fortune in recovering Ironclaw’s Atrocities will please the Baron. He will be able to press home his claims against Duke Schneidereit and recover the fiefdoms that rightfully belong to his family. If he is able to secure his claims, I am certain that the Baron will not neglect those who made his success possible. It might be too much to expect to be appointed beadle of a fief, but for warriors like ourselves a sack of gold or a new suit of armour would be more to our liking anyway. Administering peasants sounds much too peaceful to a man who crossed swords with a vampire... and lived to tell the tale.

“I will send Ironclaw’s Atrocities along with the next shipment of wyrdstone to Bechafen. Once the book is in the Baron’s hands, we’ll better know how useful it really is to him. Then we’ll have a better idea of what kind of favour we can expect from him. In the meantime, continue gathering wyrdstone. At least we know how valuable those are!”",
    "3986648686" : "“With the cranes destroyed and this stinking ogre gone, even if the Comet-spawn take back the bridge they won’t be as great a threat to the barges. The shipments of wyrdstone to Baron von Leitdorfer can be resumed. That is sure to make your patron happy and put some gold in your pocket.

“Speaking of pockets, I held my nose and went through the bag of loot that mutant ogre had tied to his belt. The things one does for greed! I won’t discuss some of the things that brute had stuffed in there, I’m just happy they didn’t belong to anyone I know. Hidden away down among all the bits and pieces, I found a book detailing marriages and alliances among the nobles of Stirland. The ogre probably hung onto it because it liked the pictures, but I’m certain we could make better use of it. The tome looks to show all the derivations of the heraldic symbols, detailing the lineages of many of the Empire’s noble families. I can’t pretend to know too much about the high and mighty, but I’m pretty sure that this kind of information could be of use to the Baron. Maybe allow him to exploit the lineage and resultant territorial claims of some of the nobles in this area. Certainly couldn’t hurt to send it along to him with the next load of wyrdstone.

“Securing the Middle Bridge opens new opportunities for you. The North-West district is where old Count Steinhardt’s Palace lies, as well as the homes of Mordheim’s nobility. I’m not sure how much is left, but there might be some rich picking among those ruins. Certainly worth thinking about.

“A man can never have too much gold, after all.”",
    "512455432" : "‘With Reiker dead the Duke will lose his most formidable agent in Mordheim. There might still be some Reavers around, but they’ll only be a shadow of what they once were. We’ve seriously hurt the Duke’s operations in the city and his coffers are sure to be impacted by the lack of wyrdstone flowing into them. Without that treasure, he won’t be able to press his claims on the Baron’s lands with graft and bribery. 

‘Baron von Leitdorfer will be thrilled to have Griffonbrand restored to his family. The sword is a legacy of his bloodline, a physical reminder of their heroic past and the services they rendered the Empire. The prestige afforded by such a legendary blade will help the Baron in his own territorial claims. Of course, the gold to be had selling that big chunk of wyrdstone isn’t going to hurt either. There are limits to what even a nobleman can accomplish by appealing to honour and tradition, but there’s few things that gold won’t buy. I think we can expect the Baron to be most generous in rewarding us for presenting him such a treasure.

‘Those Sigmarite Sisters we rescued from Reiker’s cells haven’t proved entirely ungrateful either. True, they’re displeased that we’re still shipping wyrdstone out of the city – in fact they’ve warned that the next time they see us it will be as enemies unless we repent our ways! Still, they have offered us a special reward, something they were able to hide just before the Reavers captured them. I think they mean to bribe us into leaving Mordheim! I suppose if you can’t appeal to a man’s conscience even a Sister will try to appeal to his greed. 
 
‘Of course, the funny thing about treasure is that no matter how much you have, you can always use a little bit more.’",
    "562788289" : "‘That’s the problem with sorceresses! You kill them and they disappear! Can’t leave an honest corpse behind like any decent, natural thing! At least we’re certain the hag is dead – I’d hate to think of something like her lurking in the dark and plotting revenge!

‘Without the corpse we won’t be able to help the Baron curry favour with the Temple of Sigmar. At least we’ve got his family heirloom back. Maybe that’ll be enough to ease his disappointment. I’d suggest we send along a nice big shipment of wyrdstone as well, just to remind him how valuable our services are to him. Fortunately, it seems the cultists gathered up quite a bit of the stuff to help Merga’s ritual. Rather obliging of the scum to leave it all behind when we vanquished their leader and sent them all fleeing back to the Pit!

‘The prisoners you rescued are all Sisters of Sigmar. They might not be so happy with us shipping wyrdstone from Mordheim, but they’d be even less happy being sacrificed to the Shadow Lord! They’re willing to turn a blind eye while we collect the wyrdstone scattered around the Statue. I think they’re too busy trying to figure out a way to cast down Merga’s monolith and consecrate this place after all the cultists have done to it. In any event, they’ve told me that we’ve earned their gratitude and have promised to repay our generosity should we ever have need of it.

‘I’m not sure how far their generosity goes, but the Sisters can be trusted better than most to keep their word. That’s more than you can usually rely on in a place like this!
 
‘As soon as you’ve gathered up the wyrdstone here, you’d better start searching the ruins again. We might be in the good graces of the Sisters, but Baron von Leitdorfer is going to need a lot more to satisfy him.’",
    "546010670" : "‘We will all take some solace knowing that fiend has been destroyed! That such an infernal, diabolic creature could exist even in a place as forsaken as Mordheim is enough to turn this old sellsword’s hair white! It will be a long time before I’ll be able to sleep at night. There are some horrors man simply wasn’t meant to see. Let us hope the daemon stays in whatever hell your steel has sent it to! 

‘I was right, I knew we couldn’t count on the Baron’s generosity this time. You’ve managed to rescue Wilhem, but just look at him! His mind is gone, broken by his time as the daemon’s plaything. He just mutters to himself, unaware that we’re even here. I don’t think the Markgraf will be too grateful when his son returns to him like this and without the Markgraf’s support the Baron isn’t going to be happy either.
 
‘The wyrdstone we took from the Palace doesn’t feel right either. The warriors you’ve charged to carry it seem to be dazed and distracted, as though their own minds were starting to wander. I fear these shards have been corrupted by the daemon, tainted by the monster’s vile essence. We certainly can’t send them along to the Baron! I think there’s only one thing we can do, and that is to take them to the Rock and give them to the Sisters. They’ll lock these shards away where their evil can’t hurt anyone. That might not gain us any gold, but at least we won’t be spreading this horror across the Empire!’",
    "596343527" : "‘You’ve outdone yourselves this day! Not only have you slain the beast but you’ve exterminated its abominable masters as well! And of course rescuing this old sellsword’s hide isn’t unappreciated either! I haven’t had this close a brush with death since that vampire took my eye!

‘There’s no need to worry about the Manticore being too unimpressive for the Baron! I saw the specimen they have in Altdorf and this monster makes that one look like a runt! The nobles in Bechafen would need iron in their veins not to be frightened out of their wits by this thing! We’ll cart it down to the Quayside and send it down on a barge. The Baron’s taxidermist is going to faint when he sees how big his job is. Once the Baron has this brute stuffed and displayed in his banquet hall, he’ll be the envy of his peers. That should settle his rivalry with the Duke once and for all.

‘The wyrdstone you’ve found around here seems to have taken on some peculiar properties. It seems the Manticore was trying to eat the things, then coughing them up when it couldn’t digest them. We’ll need an iron box to transport these shards as they’re too corrosive to trust to mere wood. These shards might prove even more valuable to the Baron’s alchemists because of whatever qualities they absorbed from being in the monster’s belly.
 
‘I’d advise we clear things up quickly. You may have killed the Manticore and its masters, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other dangers lurking around this place. Any time something powerful falls there is never a shortage of scavengers eager to rush in and pick over whatever is left behind.’",
    "2897198390" : "“And so the enemy’s stronghold is brought to ruin. A lonely candle defying Old Night has been snuffed out and the shadows have returned to claim their dominion. All hail the Shadowlord! Glory in Him and despair!

“Your actions today have resonated into the depths of the Pit! Gaze upon the blood you have shed, study the havoc you have wrought. Can you not see the words written there? Can you not discern the pleasure of our master? Terrible in his wroth, the Shadowlord is indulgent in his favour. You will be rewarded for your service. Defiling the sanctuary, profaning the holy icons of Sigmar, killing the deluded slaves of the godling, these have drawn the attention of the Pit to you. You should feel both honour and horror, knowing the eyes of our master are upon you!

“Behold, the holy hammer melts before my magic! Watch as the stigmata of change consumes this place! The walls pulse with glorious transition, throbbing with the purity of Chaos manifest! The power of the Shadowlord reaches into this place, draws it down into the reborn world that was brought to us upon his celestial chariot!
 
“Strip from this defiled sanctuary all that will aid you in your struggle against the unbelievers who would steal the gifts of the Shadowlord! The wyrdstone belongs to him and those who serve him, not to the inhuman beasts of the underworld or to the greedy sell-swords. The wyrdstone is ours, and death and terror shall be the price for any who dispute our claim!”",
    "2880420771" : "“Victory is ours and so too is the abomination that is Griffonbrand! Wrap the sword in this bestigor hide and lock it inside the bloodwood chest. I cannot stand the sight of the blade. Let us hope that the spells laid upon the chest will obscure the weapon’s vile aura of virtue!

“I must prepare the rites that will properly re-dedicate Griffonbrand to Chaos. Once the rituals have been performed, we shall turn the enemy’s weapon against them. Their holy sword will become an unholy blight upon their lands. Soul by soul, life by life, we will send them screaming into the vengeful embrace of the Ruinous Powers.

“Keep this a secret among ourselves. Until I have desecrated Griffonbrand, the zealots of the decadent Empire would seek to rescue the blade if they knew it was in my keeping. Even those who serve the Shadowlord would be looking for it, determined to destroy both it and me rather than risk the sword being turned against them. For they know that with Griffonbrand corrupted I shall have proven myself the most valuable of our master’s servants.

“Do not think to betray our secret. You have much to gain if I succeed and much to lose if I fail. Already I have prepared my spells. If I fall by your treachery, know that a daemon of Khorne will be loosed from the aethyr to track you down! I hope I can depend on your fidelity!
 
“The Shadowlord will reward you for this offering to his dark majesty. His eye is upon you, so as you hunt among the ruins know that our master is near! To die in the service of the immortal is better than clinging to the lies and delusions of what professes to be civilised!”",
    "2863643152" : "“Can you not feel the power of our master all around us! The Pit is a gateway between worlds, a portal between the crude material of the mortal sphere and the immortal wonders of the aethyric dimension! 

“Bring forth Fylch! Bring the vermin from the cart to the place of offering! Behold! I draw forth the sacrificial dagger! Watch the putrid blood of the ratman spill upon the stones! Watch it rain into the darkness of the Pit!

“The barriers between worlds weaken! The Shadowlord’s essence reaches out into the Realm of Chaos, drawing still more power down into himself while the breech is open! This is why he sent me the vision! This is why I was chosen! This is my reward!

“The ancient spells taught me by the Purple Hand draw forth fragments of aethyric energies. Even as the Shadowlord feeds, so too am I filled! Power! The power of change and transmutation! The glorious transfusion of Tzeentch himself! Such sorceries shall I work with this power! Such wonders and atrocities will I perform!

“No! There is more! A vision blazes across my mind! I see a great eye glaring at me. It stares from a place of books and fire! It knows what I have done and seethes with envy!
 
“I can bear the vision no more! There are horrors even a sorceress must close herself to! Return to the ruins, gather more wyrdstone for the Shadowlord. I must ponder what I have seen and contemplate its meaning. Stand at the ready. Depending on what I learn I may have need of you soon!”",
    "2981086485" : "“There is ever a slender thread between madness and genius. The former Curator of the Great Library proves that philosophy. Had he possessed a stouter heart, a stronger spirit, if his mind had been capable of adapting to the glory and majesty of Chaos… but such was not to be. He clung to the delusions of materialism and mortality, allowing his obsessions and prejudices to destroy him in the end. The Ruinous Powers do not suffer fools for long.

“Griffonbrand has been changed by the Eye. Because of the Cordial it may look the same, but the sword has been transformed by Tzeentch. The holy taint is gone, the blade’s enchantment no longer vexes my witchsight or causes me pain.

“Yet, even though the sword has been changed, it has not emerged as I expected it to. It will take time to study the blade, to examine its new properties. Certainly it is no longer a weapon of petty Sigmar, but it would be reckless to wield it without understanding what it has become. I will work divinations to determine how the blade’s enchantment has has been altered.

“Even without the Curator, the Great Library will remain a daemon-haunted place. The Eye of Change has worn down the barrier between worlds here. Aethyric energies continue to trickle into the building. Raw, unfocused, such energies are dangerous and provide nourishment for daemons to exist in our world. Without the Curator to control them, the daemons will pose a menace to all unguarded mortals who trespass here. If you again visit this place, be wary lest you are consumed by these creatures of Chaos.  I advise you seek wyrdstone elsewhere.

“Be patient. When the secrets of Griffonbrand’s change are revealed to me, you will have a weapon to raise you beyond all others who serve the Shadowlord.”",
    "1380648231" : "“Broken, burned and bleeding! So are the ambitious brought low and made humble! Rise Thag! Rise and bow to your mistress!

“You see the might of my magic? Even this monstrous beast is enslaved to my sorcery! There is awareness in those eyes! Yes, he has endured the enchantment well. That fiendishly cunning mind is intact, but the independence has been drained from it, extracted like a barber-surgeon drawing out a bad tooth. Now, Thag of the Wastes, your will is not your own! You exist only to serve Merga!

“The first task for my new slave is to undo the distress his jealous interference has caused me. The stars are no longer conducive to the ritual Thag disrupted, but the service to Chaos forces one to be adaptable. A different alignment is imminent. The spells and rites to exploit that astral conjunction are not unknown to me, but they will require a stronger binding to the firmament of this world to be properly employed. Fortunately there is an ancient Kurgan burial ground not far from Mordheim. The barrow stones that rise above the tombs have stood there since before the upstart Sigmar walked the land. Now they will be cast down, brought to Mordheim to serve my great conjuration!

“Go, Thag, and bring me the barrow stones! Use all of your strength and all of your cunning, but bring me those megaliths!

“Your aid this day will not go unrewarded. With Thag as my slave I will be even more prominent among those who serve the Shadowlord. When my great ritual is performed, I will transcend to a still more privileged communion with the Pit. I will not forget those who assisted me when that time comes. Through me, you shall experience the blessings of the Dark Gods.”",
    "1397425850" : "“Can you not feel the power? You have done more than simply vanquish the Alluress – it has been drawn into Griffonbrand! The daemon is bound to the sword, sucked down into its steel and trapped! When you destroyed its body for the final time, it tried to retreat into the wyrdstone vessels, but their alignment around Griffonbrand precipitated the Alluress into the prison I prepared for it!

“Yes, I have misled you, but towards greater purpose. The temptations of Slaanesh are formidable. Had one of you fallen victim to the Alluress’s seductions, and had you been aware of my intentions, then it would have appreciated its peril and fled. This way, it remained convinced it could retreat to its vessels. That assurance was the bait for my trap.

“The tainted wyrdstone vessels may yet prove valuable. If nothing else, they may command greater regard from the Shadowlord than the more usual shards you have brought to the Pit. For your service to me, I am content to allow you to reap such rewards as our dark master sees fit to bestow. Perhaps the blessing of mutation or the gift of magic will be the sign of his benevolence. 

“The corruption of Griffonbrand is all but complete. To complete the rite, I need but one further thing – the touch of Nurgle, the Grandfather of Plagues! The minions of Nurgle are drawn to disease and despair, many of their ilk haunt the ruins of Mordheim. For my purposes, however, we will need more than simply a mortal infected by Nurgle’s rot. We need the essence of a plague daemon, to quench the reborn Griffonbrand in the ichor of Chaos itself!

“I shall consult my crystals and bones, seek the omens that will guide us towards what I need. When I am finished, Griffonbrand will be a weapon worthy of serving the Shadowlord!”",
    "1414203469" : "“You are truly favoured by the Shadowlord! Only his valuable and honoured servants could have prevailed against such savage foes! It is arrogance to exult in your accomplishments, but it is foolishness not to acknowledge them. Your exploits have drawn the notice of every magister among the cults of the possessed. That regard offers both the glory of respect and the danger of envy.

“The manticore has been subdued, but I fear that I underestimated its strength. Perhaps the wyrdstone it tried to consume has made it resistant to my enchantments. Whatever the cause, the collar is not enough to break its will. The beast remains defiant. It is a taxing effort to impose even the most basic commands upon it. I shall need to examine it further and make a more concerted effort to tame it. Make no mistake, the manticore will serve me!

“The wyrdstones the manticore ate will require further study. Their peculiar properties may prove beneficial if harnessed the right way. Perhaps something in the tomes you retrieved from the Curator will resolve their riddle.

“For now, return to your pursuit of wyrdstone for the Pit. It will take me some time to prepare the final rite and transform Griffonbrand into a weapon worthy of serving the Shadowlord. If he favours our progress in this endeavour, perhaps his hand will stretch forth and bestow upon you one of his dark gifts.

‘Always remember that to serve the Shadowlord is reward in itself. Do not ask for recognition, but always be ready to accept such gifts as he sees fit to bestow.”",
    "1296760136" : "“Bertha and her zealots have disrupted the ritual too greatly to maintain the rift. The propitious moment has been squandered and the door closes once again! Such has ever been the way of the ignorant – to meddle in things they are too afraid to understand!

“Though the door is shut, I haven’t failed. The Shadowlord still smiles on us. With the arcane catalysers in place, I was able to open a crack between realities. Through this crack, the mighty Breath of Change spilled across Griffonbrand. The transformative energies of the raw aethyr have inundated the blade, reforging it in a flame of shadow.

“Gaze upon the weapon you have helped to make! Like a shard of midnight cast in steel, wisps of darkness bleeding from its keen edge. If you look, you can see the daemon writhing below the surface, shrieking its malevolence and rage. This is a blade worthy of the Shadowlord’s service! It is Griffonbrand no longer! I dub it Shadowbrand!

“With this weapon, none will be able to oppose us. Not the opportunistic mercenaries or the verminous Skaven, not the pious Sisters or our rivals among the Cults of the Possessed. The wise will submit or flee, the foolish will die!

“We shall become the supreme servants of the Pit. The Shadowlord has shown his favour but even greater blessings await us! We can aspire to a greater communion with our master and to us shall be revealed secrets unknown to mortal minds!

“Gold and steel are but temporary instruments of power. Knowledge is eternal and no wisdom is as immortal as that which the Dark Gods bestow!”",
    "879738524" : "“You do credit to our order and our faith! Again, our might and valour have been displayed as a warning to all those who haunt the ruins of Mordheim! The Sisters of Sigmar’s Mercy will suffer no unclean thing to defile the holy places of our god, nor will we allow evil to work its malignance unchallenged!

“Driving the Brotherhood of Shadows from the temple and thwarting their efforts to create a gateway between our world and that of the Ruinous Powers is an accomplishment that will be recorded in the chronicles of our order. This day you have proven that a stout heart and a pure mind are superior to the festering corruptions of Chaos. If ever you should have cause to doubt your purpose or the path Sigmar has chosen for you, think back to this moment when you vanquished the minions of darkness.

“I must remain here to re-consecrate this holy place. It will take time to undo the profanations of Kleinz and his creatures, but with devotion and prayer, I am certain this sanctuary can be made clean once more. Perhaps the cleansing of the temple is a sign that Mordheim itself can be redeemed from the corruption that infests it. That, however, is a mystery even the augurs cannot divine. It is not left to us to see all, but simply to see what the moment demands and do our utmost to do what needs to be done.
 
“Continue your patrols in the ruins. Gather the vile wyrdstone that it may be safely entombed in our vaults. Do not stray from your purpose merely because those who covet the wyrdstone are merely ignorant rather than evil. Recall the wisdom of Grand Theogonist Gazulgrund who said that ‘ignorance is the wellspring of all wickedness.’ Let that mantra steel your hearts when pity and compassion might make you demure. Always remember that only the gods may know who is truly innocent.”",
    "930071381" : "“Spare a moment to admire your handiwork. It isn’t simple barges that you have set afire, but rather what these ships represent. You have prevented the spread of Mordheim’s contagion to the rest of Sigmar’s Empire. Truly there is no shame in such destruction if it is to achieve such a sacred purpose. Those who would buy wyrdstone little understand the horrors they invite upon themselves. It is our duty to spare them such temptation. All those who would take the shards from this cursed city must be dealt with not simply as our enemies but as the enemies of Sigmar Himself.

“The wyrdstone we have recovered from Reiker’s Reavers must be taken back to the Rock and secured in the vaults where its malignance cannot corrupt anyone. It is a grim burden, to bring such filth into our own fortress, but where else can we be certain it cannot fall into the wrong hands? This is the trial set upon us by Sigmar, this is why the Rock and our order were spared his judgement when the Hammer of Sigmar laid low the heresy and hubris of Mordheim!

“Bestow the last mercy upon your wounded foes. Death is a kinder fate than being abandoned to the city and its horrors. We must be away from here quickly. For the moment, your triumph over the mercenaries will have frightened off most of the scavengers lurking in the ruins, but we cannot expect them to be timid for long. The lust for wyrdstone will draw them out again, like moths to flame. Before they regain their courage we must get these foul shards locked away.
 
“Make no mistake, though this has been a great victory, we have yet to purge even the smallest degree of Mordheim’s corruption.”",
    "913293762" : "“This day you have saved the Rock from a despicable and cowardly attack. There can be no question that the ratmen intended to sicken us all and then swarm the Rock when we couldn’t defend ourselves. Their objective was certainly the wyrdstone locked in the vaults. These creatures seem even more obsessed with the shards than the degenerate cults who gather around the Pit. One of their carcasses even had bits of the stuff driven into its hide like some sort of abominable jewellery! 

“The carcasses of the Skaven will be piled and burned – I would not leave even a vulture to sicken itself upon such fodder. I will send more Sisters to come and seal the burrows. We have explored them most meticulously and I am certain that you have left no trace of their vile poison or the apparatus used to craft it behind. Still, the thought of more of these vermin slinking back to claim their tunnels is too repulsive to countenance. I will rest easy only when these burrows are closed off.
 
“Your service to the Sisters of Sigmar’s Mercy will not go unrewarded. You have proven yourselves valorous and faithful, true exemplars of Sigmar. It pains me that such qualities must be hidden away in these blighted ruins, but we must accept the role that Sigmar has entrusted to us. We must be true to our convictions, to the grace that spared us from the destruction that scourged Mordheim. Whatever hideous form our foes may take, always remember that you fight not simply for yourself but for Mighty Sigmar as well. So long as we keep true to our god, what enemy can ever hope to prevail against us?”",
    "829405667" : "“It is a fearful thing to see a place of such knowledge and learning consigned to the flames, but far more fearful is the thought of the evil that made this place its refuge. Even I cannot say if the daemons will be vanquished by the fire, but I pray Sigmar that we have at least lessened their loathsome presence. At any event, without the deranged mind of the Curator to provide them with purpose, the daemonic infestation will not spread far from the ruins of the Great Library.

“I know that your warriors are weary. This has been a trying battle. Some of you barely escaped the flames as this unholy place was put to the torch. Others will bear the scars of daemonic talons all through their days. Some, perhaps, will suffer the deepest hurt of all, the doubts and nightmares inflicted upon their minds by the Curator’s obscene magic. Yet even as you count your hurts and fears, know that you have survived the storm, you have passed through the ordeal. Where others would falter, you have prevailed! It is not an accident, but the will of Sigmar that you are triumphant! It is the mark of His favour and His blessing that endows your victory!

“Return now to the Rock. Rest from your travails. Tend your wounds. Mend your doubts. The corruption that infests Mordheim persists and if it is ever to be subdued, if this city is ever to be made clean, if its evil is to be kept from the rest of the Empire – then the Sisterhood will need stalwart warriors such as yourselves! 
 
“Rest for the moment, but know that Sigmar will call upon you soon to bring His judgement against all things foul and unclean!”",
    "101275873" : "‘An Alluress of Slaanesh! Vanquishing such an infernal abomination does glory to Mighty Sigmar! Praise be to Him that we were equal to such a challenge, for surely without His divine aid we could never have destroyed such a vile daemon. Even in a place as desolate and corrupt as Mordheim it is terrifying to imagine such a malignant spirit emerging into the mortal realm. Take heart that your purity and faith were strong enough to resist the daemon’s seductive sorceries.

‘High Augur Anyier has slipped free of the daemon’s enchantment. Killing the Alluress broke the spell over her and once more Anyier’s mind is her own. The taint and corruption of the daemon, however, is not so easily cast out. Her flesh has been befouled by the daemon’s touch, her soul stained by the daemon’s magic. No penance can absolve her of such defilement. Only in death can she find absolution. She must prepare herself to offer the sacrifice which will restore her to the grace of Sigmar.

‘Before Anyier can accept her fate, however, she must be returned to the Rock. During her enchantment, she had a further vision – one that warns of a dire threat to the whole of the Sisterhood and to all of Mordheim! Ensorcelled by the daemon, she had glimpses of the creature’s mind. She was able to sense the dark energies sustaining the fiend and could likewise see these fell powers becoming stronger, descending upon the ruins in a great storm. She anticipates that these powers are being drawn to Mordheim to feed some obscene rite. Until this vision comes to pass, Anyier must be denied her doom.

‘For now, this service you have rendered me is done. You have the entire order’s gratitude. I will dispatch other Sisters to cleanse the palace of any lingering daemonic influences.’",
    "50943016" : "‘No service is more sacred to Sigmar than avenging the murder of His servants. Today you have shown these debased cultists the strength of the god they deny. You have reminded them why they hide in the shadows to work their evil. You have shown them the price of their abominations! That we might purge all of Mordheim, all the Empire, all who have defiled their souls with the atrocities of Chaos!

‘Returning the body of the champion to the Rock is an act of mercy that is certain to be rewarded by Sigmar. By honouring those who have sacrificed themselves in His holy name we perform our duty before our god. The templar will rest within our crypts, safe from the corruption of Chaos and the fell magic of necromancers.

‘Already this act of charity has been a tremendous boon to the Sisterhood. The holy hammer will make a potent addition to the Rock’s arsenal. We will contemplate its powers and decide upon how it may best be deployed to combat the foulness around us. It is the reliquary the templar brought with him which has worked a true miracle! Brought into the presence of High Augur Anyier, the reliquary began to glow with a wondrous light. Almost at once, her fever broke. The daemonic taint has been expelled from her flesh and spirit! Her mind is as it was before the Alluress seduced her away from us! The matriarchs will examine her further, but it may be that Anyier has been redeemed from her ordeal and granted another chance to faithfully serve Sigmar!

At the rate in which the beast was growing and mutating, it might well have been able to force its way down through the sanctuary and into the vaults with its next attack! What havoc the brute could have wrought once it ingested all the corrupt shards the Sisterhood has recovered it is best not to contemplate. Praise Sigmar that such a horror has been averted.

‘The rod of sorcery the heretical magister carried was intended to bind the manticore to his will. Once enslaved by the Brotherhood of Shadows, the beast would have become a menace of atrocious proportions! It is fortuitous that you were able to kill the heretic before he could complete his obscene magic!

‘The theories of our scholars have borne out. The manticore was indeed consuming wyrdstone and provoking the ghastly mutations afflicting it. The strange corrosive properties of the wyrdstone you gathered from the Market Square was altered by the acids within the beast’s stomach. The monster would grow agitated and spit them up, leaving them to smoulder on the ground while its brutish urges drove it to seek out more. Having seen what perverse uses the verminous skaven can put typical wyrdstone to, it is a good thing that they’ve been denied access to this corrosive variety. Locked away in the Rock, the ratkin will be unable to experiment with it and devise more of their fiendish devices.

The consecration of the monoliths has sealed the portal Merga hoped to open, slamming the door in the very faces of the daemons she would have unleashed. It is a temporary respite. The monoliths will need to be cast down and broken into rubble. Only then can the threat they pose be eliminated. Heretics of Merga’s awful power and occult knowledge are rare so it is unlikely any of the magisters infesting these ruins will be able to create replacements for them and repeat the ritual she intended to perform.

‘The plaza will have to be sanctified, purged of the corruption which the Brotherhood of Shadows inflicted upon it. This too, will our order see to. With prayer we will cleanse this place. Once again, the memorial of Count Steinhardt will shine as a beacon of hope to men of the Empire and serve as a warning to the creatures of darkness that heroes will rise up to oppose their malevolence and drive them back into the shadows!

‘The smallest part of Mordheim’s corruption has been cleansed. We have taken the first small step to redeeming the city from the horrors that beset it. In time, with the proper devotion and faith, this place may be restored to the Empire and returned to the keeping of Sigmar. It is towards that hope that you should continue to strive. Keep the faith, for without faith mankind would be lost entirely to the malefic powers of Old Night. Let your devotion to Sigmar be a flame against the darkness, a fire to drive back the shadows!

    "1084105976" : "“I have looked through the records left by Lothar von Diehl. The necromancer may have betrayed Vanhel and slain his master, but he certainly had a facility for detail when it came to writing down his arcane experiments. The cypher will be an easy enough one to decrypt, the true peril will lie in determining if Lothar left any magical traps woven into his rituals. That challenge, however, will be left to others. For now you have done what the Master required of you.

“It is to be regretted that the Curator couldn't be drawn into Count Vlad's service. His magic and knowledge of Mordheim would have been a valuable asset. Certainly there are spells by which his spirit might yet be called upon to serve, but it is always an uncertain thing to treat with the ghosts of the mad. One can never be entirely certain if the bindings will maintain their hold or if enough reason will remain to them that they can provide anything of value. We shall be content with his staff. It seems familiar to me, though I wouldn't care to speculate why just now. A bit more study may reveal its secrets. Perhaps it will prove a prize as valuable as Lothar's journal.

“The funerary records you've recovered are of more definite value. The famed and feted dead of six centuries and more are laid bare before us. Their names, their deeds and most importantly where they are entombed! Knowing the wards and rites by which their graves were consecrated will make breaking the hold magic a simple matter. When it becomes needful, the greatest warriors of this city's long history will rise from their coffins to serve the legions of Sylvania. 

“For now, secure more wyrdstone. It will be needed to fuel the mighty necromancy that will bring the Empire into Count Vlad's thrall.”",
    "1134438833" : "“There is no blood redolent of such savour as that of a fallen Sigmarite! Those who would hound us into the shadows, who would stalk us to our coffins and hammer a stake through our hearts! How ignoble they must feel knowing that in death their blood will nourish their enemy, their flesh will jump to our magic and their very bones will be our playthings! What does a mortal know of the sweet taste of vengeance, or of hate nurtured over seven lifetimes?

“Yes, the Sisters are fallen and the sorry clay of their martyr will soon be on its way to Drakenhof. Perhaps Count Vlad's servants will pierce the secrets of the holy aura which emanates from the corpse. Perhaps they will revive this champion and bend her to the Master's will. That would indeed make a mockery of Sigmar's divine might!

“The Temple will remain as it is, a broken ruin among the desolation of Mordheim. The rite the Sigmarites thought to perform has failed to restore the dominion of their god. This place will stay a haunt of bats and rats and all the creatures of Old Night. There will be no stronghold for the Sisters in the north, no added menace from the women from the Rock.

“Again you have earned the trust Vlad has placed in you. Don't fear, the Master remembers his loyal servants. You will be rewarded, though the knowledge that you have performed a service for the House of von Carstein should be reward in itself. We are building a new world and we shall glut ourselves on the blood of the old.

“Back to your hunt. Scour the ruins and seek out the wyrdstone. The more you gather the more power there will be for the Master to call upon when he is ready to unleash his own Great Ritual and call the dead from their graves.”",
    "1117661214" : "“There is a delicious irony in employing the tools of the enemy against them. Behold how the flames crackle and dance, consuming the last reminder of our foe. Would that all the witch hunters could be brought to such an end! The Swords of Abolition may try to reform, but never again will they pose such a menace as they once were to our activities in Mordheim. This irritant that has vexed Count Vlad for far too long is now naught but a noxious memory.

“You will be rewarded. Drakenhof has heard of your exploits here and the name of your warband is known among the von Carsteins. Loyalty is its own renown, and you have proven your loyalty to the Master. The wyrdstone you send back to Sylvania will accomplish great things. When the time comes the power within those shards will usher in an era of eternal night and an age that will belong to the undead.

“These commanders of the Raven Guard, they may look like only so many bones right now but soon they too will serve the Master. Vlad will need leaders to guide the deathless legions he will draw from the Empire's cemeteries. In life these officers were more than simply fierce warriors. They were tacticians and strategists, men accomplished in leading regiments and battalions. The imprint of their knowledge clings to these bones and when they rise again that knowledge will be utilized once more. Again they will be commanders, but this time of the fleshless legions of the von Carsteins!

“Still there is much to be done. The great magic that was conjured by Nagash and recreated by Vanhel demands a vast amount of power to give it shape. You must persist in your hunt for wyrdstone, that the Master might have such power when it is his time to perform the spell of doom.”",
    "1167994071" : "“So utterly despicable that there isn't even a sense of satisfaction in destroying them! Even the blood of skaven is vile, a black swill that stinks of all things foul! Count Vlad will need to make provision in his plans for attending to these vermin. Too often have they meddled in the affairs of their betters. Perhaps before conquering the Empire of men it will be necessary to exterminate the kingdoms of rats first.

“The ratkin you killed this day are but a drop in a sea of vermin, but if it isn't possible to kill them all it is possible to fill their craven hearts with fear. It will take some effort on the part of their leaders to make the skaven poke their noses into the Quayside for some time. Though it seems a defilement of the necromantic arts, I am tempted to send some of their dead companions back to them as zombies. That should see them truly cowering in their holes!

“The corpses you sent to Sylvania will be of great utility to Count Vlad. It is a simple enough thing to raise legions of mindless soldiers, but the commanders of those legions must be selected with greater care. They must have been leaders in life before they can be leaders in undeath. The spells to reanimate such officers are more refined than those that raise packs of zombies and skeletons, for some of the spirit must be restored along with the body. Only then is there that spark of initiative that endows the undead with any degree of versatility. 

“Count Vlad will need many more before he has a cadre to lead his legions. What you have given the Master is a start, and a beginning for which you will not go unrewarded.

“Just as the Master needs the corpses of heroes, so too will he need more wyrdstone. With the skaven routed, your hunt should be less arduous for a time. Make the most of the respite.”",
    "347220029" : "“The Nehekharan scrolls and the arcane stabilizers promise to hold the secrets of a startling refinement in the art of necromancy. I am uncertain if the methodology of the Liche-priests can be blended with the rites recorded in the Nine Books of Nagash. The Liche-priests worshipped strange and terrible gods, divinities whose awful power still lingers in the old spells. If anyone can resolve that riddle, however, it will be the von Carsteins. Mannfred in particular has made extensive study in the magical traditions of vanished kingdoms and extinct peoples. 

“The purple wyrdstone is a thing of more definite value. I can feel the dark energies emanating from within them. Their power is more refined than that of the shards you have collected before. It possesses a sympathy with the dark magic that gives necromancy its potency. Each of these wyrdstones could be used to raise whole divisions of skeletons or sunder the wards protecting even the most hallowed tomb. These too must be sent to Drakenhof, for such incredible power mustn't be used capriciously. Count Vlad will know how to best utilize these stones and put their might to its best utility.

“In considering the power of the purple wyrdstones, don't neglect the value of the usual variety. The Master needs all he can be supplied with, whatever its colour. Continue to scour the ruins and recover as much as you can find. When the time comes for Sylvania to rise against the Empire the armies of the von Carsteins must be as mighty as those that marched with Great Nagash himself. 

“Help to bring that to pass and you will have an exalted place in Vlad's regime. Fail and the Master's punishment will be a thing beyond nightmares.”",
    "296887172" : "“The ritual Mannfred prepared is a success! It normally requires a tremendous effort and a great deal of time to reanimate a corpse as large as that of an Ogre, yet this ritual enabled me to control the Chaos Ogre as though it were nothing more than a drowned kitten. The possibilities of such magic are immense! It evokes the tremendous power of Vanhel when he summoned a flight of zombie dragons to visit death upon the skaven when the ratkin invaded Sylvania. Just imagine such power at Count Vlad's command!

“More research will be needed. I fear the reconstitution of the Ogre was exceedingly transitory, but such is the ever present hazard of necromancy.

“There is always a risk when stealing from the Chaos Gods, but it would appear that your transgression has slipped the notice of Khorne. The blood offering's power is fleeting, but valuable just the same. It is to be regretted that the secrets by which the Blood God's altar endows these sanguinary sacrifices with such potency have eluded the studies of our necromancers. If such a potent liquor could be made available to all who serve Count Vlad then the von Carsteins would be unstoppable. Unfortunately, this riddle is one only the murderous acolytes of Khorne can answer.

“The red wyrdstones make for a curious prize. There is a strange energy about them, but it will need further examination to determine if it is anything that can be safely harnessed. It is an inherent quality of all things Chaos that they are difficult to constrain and control.

“Secure more of the common variety of wyrdstone so I will have specimens to match against these red ones. With the Khornate cult vanquished you will have one less obstacle in your hunt. It is possible that the red wyrdstone could be used to augment the ritual Mannfred devised.”",
    "313664791" : "“A commendable performance. Your warband is to be applauded for their determination. Certainly this was a fight beyond any you have fought since venturing into Mordheim.

“Alas, if only the ritual had performed as desired! I fear there are still problems with the intricacies of the spell. The Manticore did indeed respond to my magic, but look upon it now. After only a few hours it has decayed into a mush of gristle and bone. Such swift and extreme decay is a reaction to the dark magic with which the corpse was saturated, but instead of sustaining the Manticore's animation it has instead consumed its body. This is an unexpected complication. Possibly the red wyrdstones are to blame. I must send word to Sylvania and consult with Mannfred to learn if he has any insight into what went wrong.

“The corrosive wyrdstones you recovered from the Manticore's lair are an interesting phenomenon. These too will need to be sent to Drakenhof for further study. The Master's necromancers are certain to find a use for such unique samples. Count Vlad will reward you handsomely for their recovery.

“You are accomplishing great things for the Master. Of all his servants hunting the ruins of Mordheim, your warband has drawn his attention the most frequently. There is risk in such notice, but so too there is the prospect of greater things. Count Vlad doesn't forget loyalty just as he doesn't forgive failure.”",
    "263331934" : "“This rotten carrion is so much empty clay now, but the Master's magic will make Count Gotthardt rise again. When Count Vlad unleashes his great spell of awakening and calls all the dead from the soil of Sylvania and Stirland, Gotthardt will be there to lead them against the same Empire he once defended. The guardian will become the conqueror!

“With Merga vanquished and her followers scattered, the Cult of the Possessed will be some time gathering their strength. These strange teal wyrdstones the cultists brought with them are of a peculiar vibration. It seems perhaps these represent a new admixture of sorcery and Chaos, something they may have brought up from the Pit itself. A gift from their malignant Shadowlord?

“More than dispatching Merga, it is the destruction of this vampiric interloper that must be celebrated. I recognized the cur. He was Palatine Drego, one of Mannfred von Carstein's thralls. It is obvious he was sent here by Mannfred to steal our accomplishments. Mannfred is keenly ambitious and gravely cunning. He will brook no rivals for the esteem of Count Vlad. I wonder, though, if even serving as the Master's second is enough to satisfy his thirst for power. It may be that the rituals he has suggested to me are ones Mannfred has already perfected. What might he do with such power?

“The destruction of Drego will make Mannfred more cautious, but be alert just the same. Mannfred is a dire enemy to have. It will be even more vital to maintain the approval of Count Vlad, for only the Master is powerful enough to protect you. The beginning you have made here is but a foundation. Prove your value to Vlad and there are no heights to which you cannot ascend.”",
    "3664062432" : "“Sigmar be praised! Your valour and determination have wrought ruin upon the enemy! Even if for only a moment, brothers, you have sent the light of righteousness blazing into the blackness of their souls. You have shown them that the obscenities they worship don't hold uncontested dominion over this world. Wherever the contagion of Chaos seeks to spread, there will be courageous defenders ready to stand against them.

“It is certain now that the ratkin were intended for some loathsome sacrifice. To what purpose I cannot say, but we may be confident in assuming it would bode no good for mankind. The Ruinous Powers delight in the blood of the defiled as readily as they savour the blood of the innocent. That those who delude themselves into serving the Dark Gods fail to appreciate how readily their infernal deities would devour them is a grim irony.

“Killing the magister will diminish the activities of the Cult in the quayside. He was the mastermind of these raids and without him, the deranged cultists will lack the focus to concentrate their attentions along the river. It is a temporary victory, but one worth the effort all the same. More important has been capturing the sword he carried. Just gazing upon it I can tell it is no blade forged in civilized lands. I suspect it is a relic from the wastelands infested by the Kurgans and Norscans. There is a vile enchantment bound within it that will bear immediate study.

“The kegs of blackpowder which you recovered are a precious rarity in Mordheim. Keep them safe, brother, for they may yet be needed in our struggle against the evil that infests this city.”",
    "3714395289" : "“It is a woeful thing to watch such a repository of knowledge and wisdom burn. I can find no pleasure in such an act of vandalism, for the Great Library was a benevolent institution in its day. Many was the time I sent acolytes from Wolfenburg to consult its archives. Yet there is no question that this destruction was necessary. The daemonic infestation unleashed by Elser was too dangerous to ignore. It had to be extinguished lest the corruption spread still further and these manifestations of Chaos gain a foothold in the temporal realm.

“Your endurance and bravery stand you in good stead, brother. Surely Sigmar smiles on you for your perseverance against these most abominable of foes. The Daemonomicon will be sent immediately to Altdorf that the Grand Theogonist may consult it and uncover more information regarding Tcharfing. 

“Prudence keeps me from sending Elser along with the book. It would be unwise to send both our resources at the same time. I will hold him captive in Sigmarshaven until a suitably equipped escort can be arranged. To loose both the Daemonomicon and the one man who has delved fully into its secrets would be a great benefit to the Ruinous Powers. Until the curator can be transferred, I shall do my utmost to interrogate him here. We must learn all we can from him before the corruption can spread. Perhaps there is enough of the scholar left within him that I can appeal to that wisdom and coerce him into disclosing what he knows.

“For now you must return to the ruins, brother. Seek out the shards from the Hammer of Sigmar and prevent their theft by those who would exploit them for their own base purposes.”",
    "3697617670" : "“Glory to Sigmar, for it is only through His grace and His beneficence that we are victorious! Triumph is the validation of the righteous and the pure of heart. Be uplifted by that knowledge, but do not allow it to lay the seeds of pride in your mind. The weed of pride has brought many a great man low and caused him to forget the humility inherent in all mortal flesh.

“The danger posed by the totems has been averted. They are strange to me, for in all my studies and travels I have never encountered their like. That they exude some manner of eldritch power is undeniable. Perhaps that explains the heightened prowess exhibited by Elser's protectors? Certainly zeal alone cannot be the reason for such formidable opposition.

“Yet another subject to ferret from Elser's brain. He is defiant, but the Order of the Silver Hammer has broken even the most debased heretics. He will talk, it is only a question of how soon he can be made to understand the inevitability of his submission. 

“The swiftness with which Elser ingratiated himself with the Cult of the Possessed worries me. I think it would be dangerous to send him on to Altdorf for his heretic friends may try to intercept the caravan. Instead we will keep him here under strict guard and take added precautions against his sorcery. Altdorf will send one of the Order's most diligent inquisitors to put the question to him. I might be moved to pity Elser were proof of his villainy not so evident.

“Your victory on the bridge has recovered a great many shards from the Hammer of Sigmar. We will send them back to Altdorf where the wyrdstone can be safely harnessed to benefit our fellow man. It is to be lamented that so few understand that only Sigmar's servants are pure enough to make use of the shards.”",
    "3747950527" : "“Blessed are they who stand fast in the light and glory of Sigmar! Against the purity of His righteousness, none who carry the corruption of Chaos within them can prevail. They must succumb to their wickedness and perversity, however mighty they may seem.

“Recovering Griffonbrand is as wondrous a feat as capturing Bloodeater. Griffonbrand is a noble, heroic blade and it is a sorry thing for it to be hidden away in the dust and dark when the land has such need of its power. By your deeds, brother, the sword will again serve the cause of justice. 

“With Bloodeater secured, we have two of the five blades crafted by Elser and the Alluress. Yes, five, for the curator has confessed the fifth sword has already been fashioned. It was the final revelation he divulged before submitting to the injuries he'd suffered. When our brothers from Altdorf went to his cell to dispose of the body, all that was left of him was a mound of writhing worms. It seems the Dark Gods visited their own vengeance upon him for betraying them. Such is the kind of mercy all who bow to the powers of Chaos should expect to receive from their obscene masters.

“I will set my scouts to searching for the other swords. Though it vexes me sorely to tarry when these infernal blades can spread such corruption, we must be certain of our quarry before we strike. I have faith that Sigmar will prevail and guide us to these vile weapons in the end, but am uneasy about what havoc they might wreck before we find them. 

“Meanwhile, continue to gather wyrdstone from the ruins that we may return the Hammer of Sigmar to His temple that it may be turned to good rather than evil.”",
    "2885599781" : "“Praise to holy Sigmar that you have withstood this ordeal, brother! The might of a manticore is fearsome enough when it hasn't been coupled with the diseased magic of Nurgle. Fortunately your faith has seen you through this trial and it is the beast that now lays dead on the field of battle.

“With the capture of Wormbringer we now possess three of the cursed swords Elser helped create. If these weapons can enslave creatures as powerful as the manticore, then it is doubly imperative that we find the others quickly before they can perpetrate still greater atrocities. Even more than the Raven Barracks, the Market Square is rife with the fell energies exuded by these swords. I fear the wyrdstone you recovered is so tainted that it is rotten to the very core. It is unusable, even to those pure enough to handle normal wyrdstone shards. We must destroy it here lest its contagion be allowed to spread.

“As with Tcharfing and Bloodeater, I do not know how we can dispose of Wormbringer. I must await word from the Grand Theogonist and learn if his scholars have discovered anything new in their research. I pray for their success, for even locked away in the darkest vault I feel these obscene swords will exert a corrupting influence. The only certain way to be rid of them is to destroy both them and the daemons lurking inside their steel. It is my hope such a method will be found within the Daemonomicon.

“For now, return to your patrol of Mordheim. Vanquish such heretics and looters as you encounter and recover the pieces left by the Hammer of Sigmar. In loyal service there is exaltation and no service is more exalted than that rendered to mighty Sigmar.”",
    "2835266924" : "“For some time now the iniquities of the Sisters of Sigmar have been a source of contention among the lectors and arch-lectors of the temple. If ever these harridans were truly devoted to Sigmar, that time is long past. None who truly serve our god could be brought so low as these defiling scum! Consumed by the perversity of Chaos, gleeful helpmates of daemons! Truly you have performed a great service putting an end to these blaspheming heretics.

“The relic you recovered is indeed the one described in the Grand Theogonist's communication. It will be needed when the time comes to purify these unholy blades. I will dispatch a missive at once alerting Altdorf about its recovery.

“Mournmock's capture leaves only one sword in the hands of the enemy. I fear it is the most malignant of them all, a fell blade called Shadowbrand. Unlike the others, this sword draws its malevolence not from just one of the Dark Gods, but from the vile force of Chaos itself. Normally such an artefact would be weaker than one devoted to a single god, but Elser was convinced it would be more powerful than them all. From its name, I fear Shadowbrand may have some dire connection to the Shadowlord venerated by the Cult of the Possessed.

“I will set my scouts to investigating any rumours of Shadowbrand. If Sigmar wills it, we may soon put an end to these villainies and bring dissolution to these obscene aretfacts. 

“Let Sigmar watch over you as you continue to give battle to the vermin who infest these ruins. Remember that every shard of wyrdstone you send to the Grand Theogonist is one less that the enemy can use to spread their malice and corruption. Only the might of Sigmar's temple can reunite the Empire and we must contribute all we can to expanding the power of our temple.”",
    "2852044543" : "“Merga's power has been broken and her foul plans brought to ruin. Had she succeeded, I hesitate to consider what might have been the end result. This place might have become kindred to the Wastes themselves, a domain irredeemably lost to the corruption of Chaos. It is by the grace of Sigmar that we were in time to thwart her abominable ambitions.

“Brother, you and your warband have acquitted yourselves in exemplary fashion. To walk into such an infernal trap and emerge victorious is no mean feat. Your deeds bespeak the nobility of your devotion to Sigmar and your unwavering faith in His divine protection. It is not by force of arms alone that such a triumph is achieved but by the blessing of the gods.

“It is a relief to have Shadowbrand safely in our possession at last. Now we must pray that the scholars in Altdorf will decipher the needed passages in the Daemonomicon that will allow us to do more than merely lock away these hideous weapons. My heart will know no contentment until they have been utterly destroyed and the daemons within them exorcised.

“We are close to achieving a grand purpose, brother. Once the proper procedure has been revealed, we will expunge from these lands five profane artefacts of awful potency. With them we will also destroy the black dreams of those who would employ such evil instruments to accomplish their insidious ambitions.

“Slowly, the light of Sigmar is driving back the darkness. Give glory that we are His chosen servants in this sacred task.”",
    "2801711686" : "“You have won a great victory today, brother. The havoc that these cursed swords might have wrought throughout the Empire is incalculable. The lure of Chaos is far too often the promise of power.

“The fault for underestimating the corruption of Heinrich Elser is upon me. Had I chosen the path of the Hammer rather than that of the Anvil, perhaps my judgement of him wouldn't have been clouded by pity. I mourned the brilliant scholar he had once been and blinded myself to the full enormity of the monster he had become. It was he who was the architect of this abominable conspiracy. The Alluress was but his helpmate, a scapegoat onto which he could divert attention from himself. Certainly she was needful to him once he discovered the process for creating the Chaos swords. It was her daemonic charms that enthralled the smith and likely drew the obedience of the magister and warlock as well. With their collusion, Elser was able to have the swords forged and the old daemons translocated into the new blades.

“While the Alluress seduced champions to bear the corrupt blades, Elser returned to the Great Library to continue his studies and find spells to sow even more carnage. There he must have discovered the secret of employing wyrdstone to resurrect himself. He put this occult knowledge to the test when he allowed himself to be captured, succumbing to the torture only for his body to be transferred and restored in the circle of wyrdstone he'd prepared.

“I think now, brother, that everything Elser revealed to me was but bait to draw us here. Believing the Alluress to be the mastermind, we were unprepared to face the resurrected Curator. It is only by your valour and the grace of Sigmar that we prevailed and were able to exterminate this nest of evil.”",
    "1605528232" : "\“This barge will bring us to the docks. The Quayside is in the possession of the ratkin. If we are to use this area to speed transport of wyrdstone to the Baron, the vermin must be exterminated. Only when the last of their foul breed has been driven from the area can we safely begin to use these docks.

\“This will be no easy task. There is no surprising the ratmen, their eyes and ears are everywhere. They will be waiting for us to strike. They will have planned their ambush and laid their traps well. You must be cautious as you make your attack, but do not allow caution to make you timid. If we are to have any chance of success, speed is of the essence. The skaven are a fractious breed, but they will rally together to destroy a common foe. Reinforcements will come swarming up from the burrows of the ratkin if they think the Quayside will be lost to them. The sewers leading to their burrows must be sealed or there will be no victory for us here.

\“A band of dwarf treasure hunters failed where we hope to succeed. Fortunately, they left behind a store of blasting powder in great ironwood barrels. Find these barrels and set them at each sewer junction. We can use them to seal the openings and cut off the ratmen from their reinforcements. This must be done if we are to carry the day and make use of the Quayside.\”",
    "1655861089" : "“In my talks with refugees from the city, I have heard tales that the fonts within Sigmar’s Temple possess miraculous properties. It is said that the divine power of Sigmar himself endows the water with holiness that empowers the faithful and repulses the corrupt. Before the comet struck Mordheim, the priests would fill sacred vessels with water from the fonts and bestow them upon those they deemed pious and worthy. The waters were said to be endowed with wondrous healing properties for those who kept faith.

“The priests are gone now. Indeed, the temple itself is in shambles. Scouting the place, I have discovered abominable cultists and monsters defiling what remains. They smash the statues of saints and martyrs, scrawl obscene sigils and texts upon the walls. I cannot say whether the power of Sigmar lingers in a place that has been so loathsomely abused, but if we would still seek the god’s blessing I think we must move before the desecration is complete.

“Others have tried to save the temple. I have seen the bodies of several Sisters of Sigmar strewn about the sanctuary, killed by the depraved cultists. I believe the Sisters intended to draw upon the holy water, for some of them bear sacred vials, as the refugees described. If we are to make use of the fonts, we must gather these vials from the fallen Sisters.

“Be on the watch for a sacred relic that was hidden within the temple. If it is still here, it would be of great interest to the Sigmarite priesthood. If it can be recovered, it represents a treasure more precious than even wyrdstone. Find it, for we cannot abandon it to the corrupt creatures that prowl the ruins!”",
    "1639083470" : "\“Your services to Baron von Leitdorfer have convinced him of both your ability and loyalty. He specifically asked that I seek you out to assist me in a special service. 

\“There is, within the Great Library of Mordheim, a tome entitled Ironclaw’s Atrocities against Our Great and Glorious Empire. It details in depth the outrages of the orc warlord Gorbad Ironclaw and the valour of those who stood against the monster’s hordes. Among those heroes was Lord Maximilian von Leitdorfer, the Baron’s ancestor. Our patron believes that this history contains details about the rewards and honours bestowed upon Lord Maximilian by Emperor Sigdan after the Battle of Grunwald. That account will help to strengthen the Baron’s claim to several fiefdoms currently occupied by his adversary Duke Schneidereit. Emboldened by the support of Sigmar’s temple, the Baron wants to press his claim upon these territories and this book will give him the justification to do so.

\“Be on the lookout for any tomes dealing with magic and alchemy while we’re here. They can fetch a handsome price in these uncertain times. Sigmar will forgive such pragmatism, I’m sure.

\“Searching the Great Library will be no simple matter. There is some strange horror that lurks inside those mouldering archives, something so malefic that even the ratmen shun the place. We must be on our guard and pray that Lord Sigmar remembers us as we prowl through those haunted halls. Keep the sacred vials close to you, steel your hearts against whatever frightful power now lurks within the Library. Be vigilant and be cautious. One mistake and we may learn to our peril what it is that calls the Great Library its home.\”",
    "1689416327" : "\“We have been given a handsome reward by Baron von Leitdorfer. He is greatly pleased with the book you recovered for him. He is certain it will help to settle his dispute with the Duke.

\“At the same time, the Baron’s messenger brings us dire news. Someone or something is intercepting the barges going downriver to Bechafen. Only about a third of the wyrdstone you’ve been collecting has been reaching the Baron. Obviously this is a situation we cannot allow to continue.

\“The wreckage of the barges has been found floating down the river, so we know whatever is striking them is interested only in the cargo, not in the boats. That makes me think it isn’t simply river pirates, as they’d see the value in salvaging the barges too. I suspect it is somebody ambushing the barges while they are still within the walls of Mordheim.

\“The best place to spring such an ambush would be the Middle Bridge. That’s where I would lie in wait if I intended to hijack the cargo. Bandits or pirates, whoever is hitting the barges must be strong as the Baron has been sending guards with his cargo. We’ll have to be careful when we make our thrust against the Middle Bridge. My scouts tell me there are big loading cranes on the bridge. That could be how they’re offloading the cargo. We’ll have to be certain to sabotage those when we make our attack.

\“And if we can recover some of the missing wyrdstone, I’m sure none of us are going to complain about earning a little extra gold for ourselves.\”",
    "827065581" : "‘We’ve been afforded a grand opportunity to perform a great service for Baron von Leitdorfer. Among the nobility, our patron has no greater enemy than Duke Schneidereit. The Duke has sent his own warriors to loot Wyrdstone – the infamous Reiker’s Reavers. Captain Reiker has always been a ruthless fighter, but now it seems he has become even more dangerous. His warband discovered a massive shard of wyrdstone in the ruins and its emanations have mutated Reiker. His mind has descended into madness, making him lead his mercenaries into atrocities of despicable depravity.

‘One of Reiker’s men has had enough. Franz has witnessed his captain lead a massacre of Sigmarite Sisters and been forced to watch his own brother executed for not carrying out Reiker’s insane commands. Franz has turned on his old comrades and now seeks our help to end Reiker’s evil. 

‘As if the wealth of a large piece of wyrdstone and the chance to destroy the Duke’s men isn’t enough motivation, Franz says that Reiker has found Griffonbrand, the sword once carried by the Baron’s ancestors. If we can gain the blade our patron is sure to reward us greatly. Reiker also carries the key to his warband’s treasure room. Franz only wants the return of his brother’s belongings which are in the possession of Reiker’s ogre. 

‘The plan is simple. Myself and two of your warriors will be captured by the Reavers. Franz will convince Reiker to hold us for ransom. When you lead the attack from the outside, Franz will free us and we’ll attack from the inside. If anything goes wrong, Franz will light a signal fire. Then you’ll have to fight your way in and break us out!
 
‘Franz says there are broken doors in the Barracks the Reavers never fixed. If you find their levers you can repair them at the forge and outflank the foe!’",
    "776732724" : "‘I have learned that a wanted fugitive has escaped into Mordheim. Merga, a sorceress who was associated with the Purple Hand. The Temple of Sigmar has placed a deathmark on her. The Baron wants to gain favour with the Temple and sent some of his own retinue to hunt Merga. She killed most of them before slipping into the city. One of those she killed was a valued retainer of the Baron and had been entrusted with a precious heirloom. She stole it from his corpse. I’m not sure which the Baron wants more – her head or his family bauble returned! If we are to stay in his good graces we’d better deliver both to him and quickly.

‘My scouts have found Merga, but she isn’t alone. She has joined the degenerate cults that infest these ruins. She has become an important leader to those who serve the Shadow Lord. So we must contend with these creatures of Chaos as well!

‘Merga was seen near the Statue of Count Gotthardt, preparing some obscene ritual. It has caused a great deal of agitation in the area – even the skaven are keeping clear of it! The cultists have taken prisoners and there are a number of Magisters assisting Merga in her ritual. A warlock spied out the scene. He claims that Merga is protected by powerful spells, anchored to the monoliths surrounding her. He says there are magical shards that were taken from these monoliths. Seize these shards and shatter them against the monoliths and we’ll break her protection.

‘The prisoners are lightly guarded. We’ll need to deploy in four groups to cover every approach to the statue. Search the area and free the prisoners. If we can find one of those shards and break it, then we’ll be able to tackle Merga herself.’",
    "793510343" : "‘I have received a letter from the Baron commanding us to find a young knight, Wilhem van Hoeller. His father is the Markgraf Ernst van Hoeller, a supporter of Duke Schneidereit. The knight was in Mordheim with Reiker’s Reavers seeking fame and fortune but has gone missing. Desperate, his father consulted a witch and learned that Wilhem is alive and in the Palace of Count Steinhardt. After what we did to the Reavers the Duke doesn’t have anyone to help the Markgraf, so he appealed to the Baron.

‘The Baron hopes to gain tremendously by putting the Markgraf in his debt. Taking the support of the van Hoellers away from the Duke would shift the balance of power considerably. If the Baron is able to move ahead with his plans for expansion, we would also share in the benefits. Certainly he will reward those who helped realize his ambitions. 

‘We are to find Wilhem. I have been given a cameo that shows what he looks like. My scouts have already been dispatched to the Palace. Only one of them has returned! His report chills the blood!

‘He claims they saw a vision of unearthly beauty in the Palace, a gorgeous woman holding court in the halls. The others were drawn in by this vision, but this scout was able to break free. Beauty was revealed as utter horror – a daemon!

‘What befell the scouts must be what happened to Wilhem – enslaved by the daemon. He must be freed from his thraldom. Under no condition can he be harmed! He must be sent to the Baron alive. At the same time, you must destroy this daemon to prevent it from claiming more victims.
 
‘It is also imperative that any treasure in the Palace be kept secret. I’m not sure we can trust the Baron’s generosity this time, so we’ll just claim our reward from what we find during the rescue.’",
    "743177486" : "‘As I feared, the Baron has been less than generous in rewarding us for rescuing Wilhem. The alliance he hoped for with the Markgraf hasn’t happened, but at least the van Hoellers no longer support the Duke.

‘The Baron has issued new orders. The Baroness will be celebrating her birthday soon and most of the province’s nobility will be attending the feast. The Baron wants to impress his guests with something exotic and spectacular in his banqueting hall. He wants a trophy that will amaze the other nobles and make them appreciate his power. Inspired by the vast menagerie of strange beasts Count Steinhardt kept in Mordheim, the Baron wants us to track down some survivor of the Count’s collection and send its carcass to his castle. He will be satisfied only with the rarest and most exotic creature!

‘I have already sent scouts into the old menagerie. Their report has been less than encouraging: the cages are broken and except for a few bones, whatever was inside them is gone. However, there have been sightings of something monstrous lurking in the Market Square – a Manticore! One of my scouts says the beast is wearing an iron collar, so it’s possible the thing already has an owner. My worry now is that they’ll recapture it before we can plan our attack. While you prepare a lure to draw the beast out, I’ll scout the area myself. After all, if the beast is in too poor a condition it won’t satisfy the Baron and our efforts will be for nothing.

‘Should I fail to return from my reconnaissance, I trust you to use your best judgement. Just remember, I am your link to the Baron and without me you will loose his patronage.’",
    "519393507" : "“There is glory in terror. There is power in atrocity. You have seen these truths for yourself. You have seen the deceit the cowardly and weak call civilization, the illusion that fools venerate as order. There is but one principle that drives all life – the need to dominate! That is the reality that hides behind the veneer of morality, the falsehood of honour and the absurdity of faith!

“Faith! How the slaves of the Empire bow and grovel to their petty idols, beseeching their little deities for some miserable little miracle to reinforce their tawdry beliefs! How they hate those who have discovered better gods, who have found Powers that reward their disciples not with promises but with deeds!

“The might of our Shadowlord is all around us! He speaks to me through dreams and visions, making his will known! Behold, where you see naught but the offal of a simple peasant, I see the voice of the Shadowlord! His words are written upon the entrails! His commands are woven into the trickling blood and congealing gore!

“Our master is angered! Attend my warning – he is displeased! For too long Sigmar’s temple has been allowed to linger in the Shadowlord’s domain! Now the godling’s harlots seek to reclaim the ruined sanctuary and make it once again a bastion of their absurd faith. This will not be allowed!

“Rise up with me. Together we shall storm the old temple and defile its sanctuary. We shall cast down Sigmar’s icons and bring them to ruin! We shall profane the sacred fountains with the blood of our victims! We shall Smother the light with the Shadowlord’s malice!
 
“Obey the Shadowlord, attend his command, and you shall be rewarded. Defy his malignant will, and you will join the multitudes of his victims!”",
    "536171126" : "“Our master was pleased with the defiling of the temple. In the darkest hours, I was graced by a daemonic visitation and granted a boon by the Shadowlord. Similar reward now comes to you. 

“Show the Shadowlord your mettle, impress him with your ambition and ability! There is no limit to the fortune he can bestow upon us, treasures of flesh and treasures of knowledge! What is mere gold beside the wonder of arcane secrets or the might of a body infused with the strength of transformation! Strive, press ahead and forget the risks! To sunder the veil between mortality and infinity is worth any price!

“Our conquest of the temple has yielded a way in which we may further encourage the Shadowlord’s regard. Among the records taken from the temple, I discovered mention of the sword Griffonbrand, an enchanted weapon long employed by witch hunters to oppress the wonders of change. It was enshrined in the Raven Barracks after the death of the captain who bore it. 

“Seizing the blade and destroying it would be a great service to all who follow the Shadowlord, but I have found an even better purpose for the sword. It can be defiled much as the temple was, and turned into a weapon against those who forged it! The scrying I cast to verify Griffonbrand’s presence in the barracks also found an altar to the Blood God Khorne, hidden by an old sect of his disciples. If the sword were brought to the altar and baptised with the blood of an ogre, it could be rededicated to the Ruinous Powers!
 
“My divinations have also revealed to me a powerful band of mercenaries encamped in the barracks. With them, they have brought an ogre! There can be little doubt that all this has been prepared for us! It is a test of our resolve and determination! Think what is to be gained by passing such a test!”",
    "552948745" : "“I have been blessed with another vision sent to me by the Shadowlord. As the brain tissue of a foolish mercenary I killed oozed out into the street, it took on distinct patterns and shapes. I was afforded a view of the Pit itself! I could see myself striding into the darkness to pay homage to our master! Behind me I dragged the despicable offering that was expected of me – a ratman so steeped in depravity and evil that his spirit had provoked the Shadowlord’s appetite.

“My divinations have given me only a glimpse of this creature, a skaven chieftain named Fylch Sharptail. I have prepared a special lure of wyrdstone that will draw him out from whatever burrow he has hidden himself in. The spells of obsession and desire laid upon the wyrdstone are such that the loathsome ratkin can not resist.

“Yet resist this Fylch has! He is high enough in the regard of his vile breed that he has the protection of a cabal of skaven sorcerers. They have placed a ward upon him that defends Fylch from my magic! To break those wards, the rods of these sorcerers must be taken from them and used against Fylch. Only then can the vermin be captured and brought to the Pit. Fylch is hiding somewhere in the Quayside. Placing the lure in different spots along the river will bring him out.

“Deploy your warriors to best effect. The ratmen are numerous but they must be exterminated! The sorcerers have foreseen our attack and isolated themselves on barges in the river, but it will take more than a little water to defy the Shadowlord! Find a way to reach the miserable vermin and take their rods!

“We cannot fail in this! If the Shadowlord’s hunger is denied, our master may decide to claim those who failed him as substitute.”",
    "569726364" : "“For the past days I have pondered the vision which afflicted me during the sacrifice. Through my divinations I have found the answer. What I have seen is the Eye of Change, a powerful manifestation of Tzeentch himself. When we made our offering to the Shadowlord and the portal to the Realm of Chaos was thrown open, I was not the only one who sought to harness the released power. Another sorcerer drew upon the aethyric forces, summoning them to himself so that he might work his own magic.

“Those attuned to magical emanations like myself have easily discerned the concentration of Dhar, the Dark Wind, in the North-East quarter. The vision I experienced told me where in that part of Mordheim to focus my spells of scrying. Books! The Great Library! The old Curator is still there among the shambles of his archives. The ruination of the city has opened his mind to knowledge he was unprepared to embrace. He has been driven mad, but in that madness burns a terrible power.

“The Curator has opened a gate for daemons to enter this world. This is the Eye of Change, an open door to the Realm of Chaos. The secret of such a mighty spell must be in his grimoire. I will learn that secret!

“The Eye of Change is saturated in the transforming power of Tzeentch. It can transmute any material. Griffonbrand can be changed within the Eye, but it will need something to protect it while exposed to the mutating force.

“The Curator possesses a relic that guards him against the energies of the Eye. It is Char’s Cordial. If we capture the Cordial, it can be poured upon Griffonbrand once it has been thrust into the Eye. The Cordial will stabilize the transformation and complete the sword’s corruption.”",
    "404503890" : "“Even among the wise who know that only in Old Night can truth be found, there are those whose ambition makes them blind. My own search for greater communion with the Shadowlord has been upset by the arrival of Thag in Mordheim. A Chaos ogre drawn down from the Wastes, Thag has accumulated a following of mutants and Possessed. Only the strongest are suffered to join Thag – any found wanting are butchered for the ogre’s stew. 

“Thag is more than a mindless monster, however. He has been touched by the Hand of Change. His mind is cunning and devious beyond the nature of his kind. He seeks the esteem of the Shadowlord.

“I don’t need to explain how Thag’s ambitions are in conflict with my own. I have sought to bend the ogre to my will, but I underestimated his strength. He defied me. His latest affront was to sacrifice a Sigmarite matriarch to the Dark Gods before I could move ahead with my own plans for the same ritual.

“With his followers, Thag is more than even my sorcery can overcome. The gift of mutation has endowed him with an almost troll-like ability for healing wounds. He has been able to bestow this gift upon his most favoured followers by letting them drink his blood. This makes them almost unstoppable, though in my scrying of them I have observed that injuries inflicted by fire take far longer to heal than other wounds.

“Thag has secured the Middle Bridge for his lair. His warband preys on the barges that try to remove wyrdstone from Mordheim. It is here that we will strike him. Old Skaven tunnels under the bridge will afford us a path right into his stronghold. The warp poison globes left by the ratkin will be our weapon. With the oil once used to light the bridge, we will destroy Thag’s minions and force him to submit to my magic!”",
    "387726271" : "“My studies of the mad Curator’s tomes have at last yielded the secret of transforming Griffonbrand. One of the principle concepts involved in the process is creating a doorway, a transitional phase between the mortal world and that of daemons. Inundated with aethyric energies, the sword’s existence will become mutable and inconstant. Pliable for the one who knows the proper enchantments.

“The Shadowlord must favour my intentions to corrupt Griffonbrand, for what I require to create this doorway is here in Mordheim! In my divinations, I detected an aethyric dissonance centred upon Count Steinhardt’s old palace. The ruins have become dislodged from the firmament of physicality, persisting as a crossroad between worlds. What has caused this to occur, I am unable to determine. My efforts to scrye the ruins were blocked. A powerful daemon has made the palace its abode. Whether it has caused the aethyric disruption or is simply taking advantage of it, I do not know. What is clear is that the daemon is able to persist in the mortal world because of the disruption.

“The daemon must be overcome. It is existing without the benefit of a mortal host, something it could only do if it invested its essence in some other vessels. What that is, my spells have not been able to discern. It would guard such a secret closely, as long as these objects remain it will be able to reform itself even if its body is slain. Killing the body will drop the protections hiding these vessels and my spells will then reveal them.

“The daemon is a creature of Slaanesh and it has made the ballroom its abode. The vessels must be near. Take Griffonbrand to the ballroom when you face the daemon. Place the revealed vessels around the blade and we may use its residual energies to vanquish the daemon for good.”",
    "370948652" : "“My magic has revealed to me the beast that escaped from Count Steinhardt’s menagerie. It is a manticore, a fantastically rare monster seldom seen in the Empire. To capture such a creature and bind it with my sorcery would give me a potent weapon to loose against those who would oppose the Shadowlord!

“The manticore has made a lair for itself in the old Market Square. The pool I used to scrye it revealed the beast feeding on a hapless band of mercenaries. But there was more – something that lends an even greater immediacy to tracking the monster down. Perhaps drawn by the corpses of the manticore’s kills and the misery of its victims, several daemons of Nurgle – foul plaguebearers – are lingering around the plaza. They are protected by an arcane altar standing near the fountain.

“The tokens of Nurgle which I have prepared must be brought to the altar. Only when their energies have been transferred into Griffonbrand can the spirit of the Alluress be completely subdued. Be wary – you may feel fatigued carrying such potent talismans. It is no small feat to carry the Grandfather’s sigil.

“As for the manticore, I have enchanted a collar that will serve to enslave it. Subdue the beast and put the collar about its neck – then the magic will reduce it to subservience. The brute has been consuming wyrdstone, spitting up the indigestible shards all around its lair. The shards have reacted oddly to the acids in its stomach, lending them a corrosive property. Collect these for me to study further. It may be that they can be of some service to us.

“The risks are great, but so too is the prospect of reward.”",
    "354171033" : "“No, my friends, your senses do not desert you. It is I, Merga, speaking to you by transference of my aethyric shadow. My mortal body is away in the plaza where Count Gotthardt’s statue stands. I need your aid, and quickly! 

“I was nearly ready for the final ritual. Thag brought the last of the Kurgan barrow stones into Mordheim, setting them into place in the plaza. Arranging the stones into a circle created a magical nexus and transformed the statue into an arcane fulcrum. A few more rites and all would be in readiness to throw open the door to the Realm of Chaos. 

“Then catastrophe struck. That simpering zealot Bertha and her fanatics surrounded the plaza, seeking to disrupt my work. I loosed Thag and the manticore against them. The High Augur was devoured by the beast, but the madwoman must have foreseen such a doom and prepared herself as a martyr. When the manticore ate her, the collar I employed to bind it melted from its neck. The beast was freed once more and quickly left the area! 

“It is well that you were away gathering the arcane catalysers! Thag and myself aren’t enough to hold back the Sisters and the manticore. You must counterattack and drive these fanatics from the plaza before the ritual is undone!
 
“The catalysers must be put into position and the gateway opened before the Sisters can destroy the circle! Once the rift is open, Griffonbrand must be placed upon the threshold, held between worlds. Until that is done, the sword is useless to us. You must hold the Sisters back until I can complete the magic that will remake the blade!”",
    "3231833733" : "“You do not need the High Matriarch of our order to tell you that this city is contaminated with a corruption that is a blight of soul as much as it is of the flesh. Mutation is but the outward sign of the rot gnawing away within the heart and the soul. It is for this that no less than Grand Theogonist Johann Helsturm established the commandment that the mutant shall not be suffered to live. 

“More vile than those who are corrupted are those who embrace their defilement with open arms and sing praises to the Ruinous Powers. Blighted Mordheim has become the lair of many such revolting cultists. One of the most noxious of these daemon-worshippers is the Brotherhood of Shadows. They number among their abominable congregation many petty sorcerers, perverse magicians who seek to draw still more corruption down upon the city in order to expand their own diabolic powers. 

“Our augurs have divined that a magister named Kleinz is leading a warband of the Brotherhood in an effort to defile and de-consecrate the old Temple of Sigmar. A sorcerous fulcrum would be conjured into being, a permanent doorway through which the corruption of Chaos will spill across the land. I do not have to tell you that this must be prevented at all costs.
 
“We will deploy at the front of the temple. I fear the taint of foul magic's will be obvious. Do not let fear distract you. We must act swiftly and with purpose. We must use the Relic to re-consecrate the fountains and cleanse the holy bell. The simple hammers adorning the statues of the arch-lectors must be replaced with the sanctified bronze hammers drawn from the vaults beneath the Rock, thereby strengthening the purity of the temple. Finally, Kleinz must be destroyed as a warning to any other cults who think they can profane the house of our god.”",
    "3181500876" : "“Through your help, the Temple of Sigmar has been re-sanctified and may once again serve as a beacon of our god’s light. I hope you will accept a small reward drawn from our order’s treasury. I trust you will put it to good use in defying the forces of darkness wherever they may prowl. 

“I fear I must again request the service of your arms. As you know, it is the aim of our order to keep the corrupt taint of wyrdstone from spreading further than it already has. To this purpose we scour the ruins trying to find the loathsome shards and bring them back to the Rock where they may be safely locked away. In this task we are opposed by adversaries both human and inhuman who covet the shards for their own. 

“One such adversary is a group of mercenaries called Reiker’s Reavers. These sell-swords have managed to seize control of the Quayside and are using the docks there to load great quantities of wyrdstone onto a barge. It is their intention to sail their abominable treasure down the Stir and to Wurtbad where they can sell it off to the decadent nobility. They are either unaware of or are unconcerned about the taint associated with their treasure. The lure of gold has blinded them to such qualms. They will not listen to our warnings and we are compelled to use force to thwart their designs. 

“We will deploy near the waterfront. A pirate ship recently floundered near the docks and there may still be kegs of powder for its cannon inside. You can use these to sink the barges the mercenaries are using. Whatever happens, we must not allow the wyrdstone to leave Mordheim! These villains have been afforded every opportunity to relent, now they must earn the consequences of their greed!”",
    "3198278495" : "“For some days now, a strange miasma has been growing around the shores of the Rock. A mephitic vapour that has caused the Sisters patrolling the walls to fall ill. Until recently, it was believed that this strange mist was a further manifestation of Mordheim’s corruption. Last evening Sister Magda observed a bottle caught in the current and driven against the rocky shore. When the glass broke, a noxious gas was released, adding to the miasma around our fortress. 

“We have since recovered one of these bottles intact. The bottle is common enough, but inside is a poisonous concoction that swiftly turns into a vapour when exposed to open air. The miasma is a direct result of scores of these bottles being cast into the river and carried to the shore of our island. A fiendish mind is behind this cowardly attack against the Rock and the Sisterhood! 

“The enemy is the most vile imaginable – the insidious ratmen, the underfolk of legend! Our augurs have divined that the creatures have a nest on the Middle Bridge where they create this poison and cast it into the river. Their leader is a cunning beast named Fylch Sharptail. This villain must be eliminated, along with any sorcerers who might know how to create this foul brew. The ratmen have adorned the span with their profane bells, marking it as their own territory – these must be cut down and cast into the river. We must also destroy their stores of poison and the apparatus they employ to fabricate their murderous concoction. If this means descending into the burrows of these vermin, then so be it!
 
“The task ahead of us is perilous, but make no mistake, the future of our order is in question! With the glory of Sigmar to shield us, with His righteous judgement to steel our courage, we will prevail against these vile skaven!”",
    "3147945638" : "“The Sisters will be forever in your debt for the destruction of the ratmen. However, just as there is no rest for the wicked, so the vigilance of the righteous must never cease. Over the last days, our patrols have encountered numerous daemonic creatures in the ruins of the North-East Quarter, far beyond what is typical even in a place as accursed as Mordheim. 

“For some time it has been known that the Great Library has been a centre of daemonic manifestations. Even when it was the greatest repository of knowledge in Ostermark, the Library had a sinister reputation, rumours of profane tomes locked away within its secret archives. Since the Hammer of Sigmar descended upon the city, the Great Library has become infested with daemons, spectral manifestations of Chaos and the Dark Gods. While this infestation was limited to the walls of the Great Library, there was hope that it might dissipate on its own. Now such timid optimism must be rejected as an idle dream. Evil will not retreat of its own accord and if left unchallenged will only grow in its malignancy. 

“I must warn you that another warband from our order has tried to combat the evil within the Great Library. They were overwhelmed, but a survivor lived long enough to warn of what they found. The old Curator is still there among the archives, but he has become a mad, corrupt sorcerer. Using the secrets of his eldritch tomes, he has brought daemons into our world and mutated beasts and men into foul and chaotic forms. While he lives, his blasphemies will continue. 

“There is no saving the Great Library, it is beyond even my powers to sanctify the place. It must be purged with fire. The Curator must be killed. The Dark Tomes must be recovered and locked away in our vaults so that their evil may never be unleashed again.”",
    "4010296384" : "‘Sisters! Calamity has befallen our order! High Augur Anyier is no longer among us! The rumours you have heard whispered within the Rock are true. For nearly a fortnight, Sigmar’s Seeress has been beset by troubling visions and ghastly nightmares. She withdrew to the seclusion of her cell above the north chapel in order to purify her thoughts and seek to divine whatever prophecy lay hidden within these portents. This morning, however, when the novice attending Anyier brought her gruel, she found the cell empty! As impossible as it seems, Anyier vanished during the night!

‘More ominous is the fact that every augur within the Sisterhood was wracked by troubling dreams during the night. All experienced a vision of a great serpent, a snake of hideous beauty coiling itself around the Rock, its forked tongue whispering obscenities to them in their sleep. The wise among our order say that such a vision must be a sending of the perverse Prince of Chaos, Slaanesh!

‘I don’t need to impress upon you the hideous threat to the honour and purity of our order if the High Augur has been tempted away from serving Sigmar and has become corrupted by the Dark Gods! Already there are witch hunters who consider the Sisterhood to be apostate, if they should discover that a personage as revered as Anyier has betrayed Sigmar then they may gather in a crusade to annihilate the Rock!

‘Some of the augurs who have recovered from their nightmares have shared with me a premonition that they experienced while praying in the north chapel. They insist that a voice told them to seek Anyier in the ruins of Count Steinhardt’s palace. What madness could have drawn her to a place redolent of evil, I do not know, but it must be destroyed!’",
    "4060629241" : "‘High Augur Anyier has been plagued with severe fever since her return to the Rock. The daemonic corruption that taints her cannot abide the holiness of our fortress and as it suffers, so too does the body it has violated. Anyier may yet perish from her affliction and be denied her chance to atone for her apostasy.

‘Today for the first time, the High Augur’s delirium broke and she was able to speak. What she had to say was ominous. It seems the malignance of the Alluress continues to haunt her, tormenting her with unsettling visions. She could see a mighty champion of Sigmar, one of His templars, ride into Mordheim to cleanse the ruins of the evil infesting it. Had Anyier been able to give us warning of the champion the Sisterhood could have set out to protect him. Instead, her fever silenced her tongue and she was tortured by the vision of this great man and his entourage beset by the Brotherhood of Shadows. Though he fought valiantly, the templar was captured! Taken to the old Raven Barracks, the cultists sacrificed him to the Dark Gods!

‘Though the champion has fallen, his body and his regalia remain in the hands of the heretics! The holy hammer with which he made battle against the cultists is a sacred relic forged by the dwarfs, a weapon of tremendous power. The reliquary he brought with him is a Sigmarite talisman from the days of Grand Theogonist Gazulgrund! These treasures cannot be lost to the slaves of Chaos! More, we cannot allow the body of such a holy man to be left to rot in the ruins. His corpse must be brought back to the Rock, purified by the Sisterhood and entombed in a place of honour within our own crypts.

‘The cultists remain in force at the barracks. We must purge the place of them and their filthy idols. Then we must reclaim Sigmar’s own!’",
    "4043851622" : "‘For some time, a winged beast has been harassing the Rock’s battlements. In the bestiaries, the monster is described as a manticore, a ferocious creature that haunts the desolate wastes. Such a beast was part of Count Steinhardt’s menagerie before the Hammer of Sigmar fell upon Mordheim. If this is the same brute, then it has grown considerably. More than grown, it has mutated! Even since it first began attacking the Rock, the manticore’s size and appearance have changed – as has its viciousness! In its last attack it killed four Sisters before finally being driven off!

‘It is more than simple hunger that draws the beast to assault the Rock. Each time it comes, the manticore flies low around the foundations of the fortress, snuffling and sniffing at the walls before attacking the battlements. It senses the wyrdstone locked away in the vaults and is striving to reach the shards! Some of our scholars believe the creature is eating wyrdstone and this has mutated it so horribly!

‘Whatever brings the beast to us, we can’t allow its attacks to continue. It was wounded in this last attack and it was seen flying down into the old Market Square. It seems the beast has its lair among the abandoned stalls and broken fountain. My scouts warn that we aren’t the only ones who’ve found the monster’s lair. They have spotted the Brotherhood of Shadows in the area, one of their magisters leading them. They may be seeking to capture the manticore for their own profane purposes. Clearly they have to be thwarted. Magister and manticore must be slain. For good measure, burn the beast’s mutated carcass.

‘My scouts also report a strange kind of wyrdstone in the area – and some skaven as well. Keep the ratkin from stealing any of the shards and bring whatever you can recover back to the Rock.’",
    "4094184479" : "‘The divine visions of High Augur Anyier have brought us to this place. The Brotherhood of Shadows seeks to exploit the dark magic being drawn to Mordheim. The infamous sorceress Merga is leading the cultists in perpetrating the supreme abomination. They are erecting a circle of stone monoliths around the Statue of Count Gotthardt. The monoliths have already been dedicated to their Dark Gods by obscene sacrifices, attuning them to the malignant energies Merga seeks to harness.

‘If the Brotherhood of Shadows isn’t stopped, Merga will be able to transform the Statue of Count Gotthardt into a magical fulcrum. It will become the keystone to a gateway between our world and the Realm of Chaos! Winds of corruption and madness will explode across the land, mutating and destroying everything in their path. Daemons will be freed to roam the countryside, sustained by the fell energies pouring from the gate. Even worse, witches and sorcerers like Merga will be able to tap into these malignant forces, empowering them to commit even greater atrocities!

‘To end this insanity, the monoliths themselves must be turned against Merga! As her ogre was transporting the monoliths, splinters of stone broke loose. Find the shards that have fallen from each monolith and purify them with holy water. When the purified shard is brought back to the stone, the profane power that infuses them will be nullified. Both Merga and the ogre she is using to move the monoliths must be slain lest the Brotherhood tries to repeat this ritual elsewhere in the ruins.

    "1342611443" : "“It is a great distinction that Count Vlad pays you. Your name must be held in some regard in the cobwebbed halls of Drakenhof. The Master has seen fit to reveal to you some small measure of his intentions. Know that Sylvania is a desiccated land, a withered thing that cannot sustain the ambitions of the von Carsteins. To prosper we must expand into more vibrant lands where the blood is young and fresh. The Empire is fractured, province set against province, every arrogant noble proclaiming the crown as their own. Never has there been a more propitious time for conquest.

“But the Master is wary. Present the squabbling mortals with a common enemy and they will unite. To guard against that eventuality, Vlad would reconstruct the Great Ritual by which the necromancer Vanhel first drew the undead legions from the plague-ridden soil of Sylvania. The Master would raise an army unseen since the days of Nagash. The first step to rediscovering those lost secrets is in Mordheim.

“Baron Lothar von Diehl, the treacherous apprentice of Vanhel left a journal of his experiments. That tome eventually found its way back to Lothar's relations in Mordheim, eventually to be consigned to the city's Great Library. Vlad wants that book and securing it is the duty that has been imposed on you. Secure it and you will enjoy Vlad's favour. Fail and there will be no peace even in the grave.

“The Library is defended by the old Curator. Since the cataclysm, he has become both a deadly sorcerer and a deranged madman. Defeating him will mean breaking the arcane wards he's placed in the Library and securing the magical staff he carries.

“Be vigilant as well for funerary records. It will be useful to know where Mordheim's heroes of old are entombed when Vlad raises his armies.”",
    "1359389062" : "“Little is the need to remind you that there are forces in the mortal world antithetical to our powers. None has proven as persistent as the followers of the god Sigmar, for it was his warhammer that struck the hand from Great Nagash himself when the undead first sought to lay claim to the Empire. That divine power lingers on, granting protections to those who would defy the necromancer, the wight, and the vampire. 

“Despite the ruinous state of Mordheim, the followers of Sigmar stubbornly refuse to abandon this place. An order of women, the Sisters of Sigmar, maintains a fortress on the river. These warriors have been a continuing obstacle to our activities, but now the threat they pose may be magnified. One of their champions was slain in combat recently, but even in death she remains an enemy. The corpse of this martyr pulsates with holy emanations, an aura inimical to the undead. A warband of Sisters intends to inter this martyr in the old Temple of Sigmar in the north of the city.

“This cannot happen! Should the martyr's holy aura be melded with a ritual of cleansing, the ruined Temple could be sanctified, transformed into an inviolable bastion of Sigmar's presence. The Sisters would have a stronghold which no undead could invade.

“You must find the martyr's sarcophagus and disperse the sacred energies surrounding it with the death totems I have provided you. Then it will be safe to secure the martyr's corpse. We will also need to attend to the reliquary the Sisters are employing to conduct their ritual. The Death Ward will be needed to counter its power. Once it is neutralized you will secure it so no other Sigmarites can use its power against us.

“The font which provides the Sisters holy water may also be defiled with the Death Ward, should you be able to locate it.”",
    "1376166681" : "“For far too long the Swords of Abolition have interfered with the servants of Count Vlad. These witch hunters have put entire warbands of undead to the torch and their efforts have seen chests of wyrdstone removed from Mordheim and transported back to their Grand Theogonist in Altdorf. Of all our adversaries in the city, these Sigmarite fanatics have been the most unrelenting. Their destruction is something the Master has desired now for quite some time.

“I am therefore pleased to inform you that these Sigmarites were recently engaged in a fierce battle with the Cult of the Possessed. The mutants and cultists took a heavy toll from the witch hunters before they were vanquished. Weakened by the fighting, the Swords of Abolition retreated into the old Raven Barracks to rest and fortify themselves. 

“This is a grand opportunity to settle accounts with these witch hunters. They are vulnerable, ready prey for any bold enough to dig them out of their refuge. Your warband will gain the esteem of Vlad by disposing of these Sigmarites. It will not be an easy task, but there will never be a better time to strike against them.

“To complete the destruction of the warband, you must kill Captain Helmut Kampfer and his two disciples. The wagon in which these fanatics carry their icons and paraphernalia must be put to the torch as well. We'll see how the witch hunters like the sight of flames!

“There is another reason for going to the Raven Barracks. The funerary records you recovered relate that the commanders of the Raven Guard were being removed from the crypts under the fortress to be buried in the Garden of Morr. This was shortly before the comet struck Mordheim, so it is more than possible that their bodies are still in the Barracks. If they are there, they must be recovered.”",
    "1392944300" : "“Mordheim is too uncertain a place to store the bodies of the Raven Guard commanders. There are too many who might make use of them and setting a guard on their coffins has become burdensome. I have been in contact with Count Vlad and in his wisdom he has sent a ship to bear the coffins back to Sylvania. Even now it waits on the River Stir.

“The vessel cannot dock, however. My spirit familiars have discovered the reason why. The Quayside is infested with skaven. The pestiferous ratkin who long ago despoiled the palace of Nagash the Black and who sought to cast down the haunted tower of Vanheldenschlosse, even again are these filthy beasts interfering in the ambitions of the Aristocracy of Night! It is not enough that they steal every speck of wyrdstone they can ferret from the ruins, now they deny transport of new servants for the Master.

“The skaven must be driven from the docks. The best way to settle the beasts is to overwhelm them with a show of force. Find the biggest rat and kill it, then the others will loose heart and scurry back to their burrows like the cowards they are.

“While battling the skaven, it would be wise to keep an eye out for an old shipwreck that is mentioned in the funerary records. It seems the captain and his mate were left in their ship rather than removed to the Garden of Morr. Their bodies might be as useful as those from the Barracks. Vlad will need captains at sea as well as land.

“The ratkin aren't without their own magic. The fog that stubbornly clings to the docks emanates from a totem the skaven have erected. If we can secure that totem and set it on our ship, then it will be safe from the attentions of Stirland's river wardens. There will be no fear of the wardens seizing a ship hidden inside fog!”",
    "1248510178" : "“I have been researching the history of Mordheim and in that study I have found many fascinating accounts of the city's rulers. One record relates that Count Steinhardt engaged the services of a warlock to preserve his favourite pet when it died. Through arcane rites the conjurer was able to stave off the effects of decay and endow the body with suppleness and pliability so that it might be posed and reposed to suit the Count's whims. 

“It is certain the warlock employed necromancy to effect such magic. Further, from other accounts I've discovered that he performed his ritual by consulting a set of papyrus scrolls plundered from the pyramids of desolate Nehekhara. What secrets of the Liche-priests the warlock deciphered are unknown to me, but it is certain they remain within the palace. After seeing the warlock's magic Count Steinhardt developed a terror of the man and had him executed before he could leave the Count's service.

“I have prepared a Death Ward that should prove useful in negating whatever magics the warlock used. Once these aethyric conduits are docile they must be gathered along with the Nehekharan scrolls. Together these will make a grand tribute for Count Vlad and will go far in assisting his own plans.

“There are rumours of a strange purple wyrdstone that has been found in the palace by those bold enough to venture there. It is said this strange wyrdstone is an even greater conductor of dark magic than the usual variety. These shards must be collected and sent to Drakenhof. They cannot be left for others to find... those who may not share the ambitions of the von Carsteins.”",
    "1231732559" : "“A murderous warband devoted to the Blood God Khorne has taken control of the Middle Bridge. These savage cultists have raised up an altar to the Chaos God and through gory sacrifices have dedicated it to him. Such has been the slaughter that an atmosphere of death hangs over the bridge, a mystic miasma that conducts not only the malignance of Khorne but also the dread energies of necromancy.

“Mannfred von Carstein has deciphered the Nehekharan scrolls and conceived a ritual that may evoke their power in a manner we can use. The aura of death that hangs over the bridge makes it a perfect site to perform the ritual. Indeed, the Chaos Ogre who serves the warband will make an excellent subject for the experiment!

“To control the arcane energies that hover about the bridge you will need to lower the Death Totems I have prepared from the cranes so that they are just above the level of the river. Then the altar of Khorne must be seized. The blood of the sacrifices must be drained from the basin and then the altar  prepared for the ritual. Kill the Chaos Ogre and bring his heart to the altar. Then we shall see if Mannfred's spell will succeed!

“Before you drain off the blood from Khorne's altar, you may find it a potent restorative. Steeped in deathly energies, it will boost the vitality of our undead. The benefit will be short-lived, but enough to aid us in this battle. Don't delay too long in draining the basin, because while it is full the altar remains consecrated to Khorne and impossible to use in the ritual.

“The wyrdstones on the bridge appear to have absorbed the murderous energies of Khorne. Secure them, for they may prove even more useful than the usual variety. In all events they cannot be left behind for our many enemies to find.”",
    "1214954940" : "“Studying the red wyrdstone has suggested to me certain refinements to Mannfred's ritual that should increase the efficacy of the spell. There is a sympathy between the red stones and the death-energies of necromancy. Harnessed properly, that harmony will compound the magic tenfold.

“I intend to test these refinements on a subject of far greater scale than the Ogre I used before. The ghosts of Mordheim have shown me where such a beast may be found. In the Market Square a survivor from Count Steinhardt's menagerie has established its lair. For some time now the plaza has been the haunt of a fearsome Manticore. Terror of the monster has caused the square to be shunned by all but the boldest warbands, for the bones of its many victims lie strewn about the ruined fountain at its centre.

“The Manticore will need to be overcome first. You will need to kill the beast and remove its heart as you did with the Ogre. The creature appears to have developed a taste for wyrdstone, consuming the shards and later ejecting them back at its lair. The presence of so much wyrdstone has saturated the area around the fountain. It will serve as a suitable site to perform the ritual.

“A note of caution before we embark on this task. The spirits have also revealed to me that there are others who hunt the beast. A warband of mercenaries, Reikhart's Reavers, have taken it into mind to secure the monster's pelt for their patron. Clearly you cannot permit this. The mortals will need to be driven off or exterminated. It is no less than they deserve for daring to interfere in the Master's affairs.

“Though, upon reflection, their presence may be useful if they've engaged the services of an Ogre. A brute like that animated by my magic could make subduing the Manticore much easier.”",
    "1198177321" : "“The funerary records you recovered from the Great Library continue to serve us well. Buried in the morbid accounts I came upon reference to the disinterment of Count Gotthardt from the crypts under the Palace. Searching further I discovered that his remains were interred in the base of the statue raised in his honour. The Statue of Count Gotthardt is not merely his memorial. It is his mausoleum.

“I don't need to tell you of the legends that surround the heroic Count Gotthardt. It is enough to know that he is still revered by the people of the Empire. Imagine then how immense their despair would be should their hero return from his grave to lead an army of the undead against them! Such a conflict would raze the morale of any force the Empire sent into the field. The Master has considered my plan and decided that it shows merit. You are to exhume Gotthardt from his hidden tomb and ship the corpse back to Sylvania that it may be available when Count Vlad has need of it.

“The mausoleum is certain to be guarded by wards laid down by the priests of Morr. Fortunately the Cult of the Possessed has chosen the area to conduct one of their profane rituals. The Chaos magic will weaken the old wards, but such undirected corruption cannot break them. To do that you must dispatch Merga and her followers. The arcane stabilizers I have prepared will be used to conduct the Chaos energies, distilling form them the very essence of death. It is that power which will shatter the old wards and leave Gotthardt's corpse vulnerable.

“I fear others have learned my plan. The entourage of another vampire has been seen haunting the vicinity. We may have a rival waiting to steal victory from us. Destroy him.”",
    "2274527537" : "“These cursed ruins are like a lodestone, drawing all the evils of these lands to it. Debased heretics, abominable mutants, inhuman monsters, and even the daemonic horrors of Chaos manifest have all descended upon the blighted streets of Mordheim. It is tempting to take comfort when the foes of Sigmar give battle to one another, but there is danger in such complacency. Harken to the words of Grand Theogonist Gazulgrund who said 'The enemy of my enemy is still my foe.' Though they perform a service to mankind when they slaughter one another, never loose sight they are still a threat to the civilization Sigmar entrusted to us to preserve.

“A river pirate, staunch in his faith if lax in his morals, has related to me the strange scenes he has witnessed in the Quayside. The Cult of the Possessed has been raiding the area, not simply for wyrdstone but to delve into Skaven tunnels and abduct the ratkin. That the cultists and the Skaven should be at odds is to be expected, but that the cultists should take pains to capture the vermin alive is troubling.

“Sometimes it is needful to have an understanding of magic in order to combat its menace. I have had cause to study certain grimoires seized from witches. The foul blood of the Skaven could be used to perform obscene rites that could further empower the Shadowlord's minions. We cannot let such a ritual occur. If needs must, the blackpowder stored in the docks could be used to destroy the site of such sorcery.

“Our course is clear. The Cult must be crushed, their Skaven captives killed. The heretics are lead by a savage magister who wields a sword emblazoned with the vile symbols of Tzeentch. This villain must die and the foul blade seized. Studying the relic may shed some light on the nature of these cultists and their ambitions.”",
    "2224194680" : "“It is a dire task that awaits us, brothers. I have sent the foul sword you recovered to Altdorf for further study. The Grand Theogonist himself has sent word back to me. My fear that it is a weapon forged in the barbaric Wastes has been justified. The blade is called Tcharfing and was borne by the Norscan High King Ormgaard when the hordes of Chaos briefly conquered Marienburg. What I took to be a mere enchantment, however, has proven far more malignant. There is a daemon bound within the steel.

“Destroying Tcharfing is a prospect rife with dread, for doing so may free the daemon. Fragments from a tome called the Daemonomicon hint that there is a way to safely dispose of the blade. A more complete text could provide the knowledge we need. Unfortunately, the only known copy outside Altdorf was held in Mordheim's Great Library.

“The duty entrusted to us, brothers, is to delve into the ruins of the Great Library and recover the tome if it still exists. The building has become a bastion of corruption. My scouts have told me that daemons prowl the abandoned halls. More, they tell me that the old curator, Heinrich Elser, has been seen performing unspeakable rites. An acolyte of Verena now practising the very sorceries he once fought to suppress.

“Debased and mad as he may have grown, Elser's study of the Daemonomicon could be a boon to us. If we can recover both the tome and the curator we may unlock Tcharfing's secrets. Capturing Elser alive will be no easy feat, but his interrogation is vital.

“The Great Library is too accursed to be redeemed, I fear. The other volumes of arcane lore and the black arts in its archives must be destroyed and the building itself purged with fire. It would seem, brother, that we already have need of the blackpowder you captured on the quayside.”",
    "2240972299" : "“Dire tidings I bring, for I must confess that Elser has escaped me. Despite my precautions he was able to enchant one of my acolytes into freeing him while I was away. The poor boy attacked me when I returned and I had to send him into Sigmar's keeping. My scouts have tracked Elser back into Mordheim, but first I must tell you what has been discovered about Tcharfing.

“The Daemonomicon describes a ritual by which four infamous swords devoted to the Dark Gods can be summoned from wherever they were lost, conjured by the names of the daemons bound within them. Once all four have been called, their energies can be harnessed to sire a fifth sword, a blade of Chaos itself. The details of this dark rite are still being deciphered from the cypher in which the tome was written.

“This is why, brothers, it is vital that Elser be recaptured. He knows the cypher and can reveal the details of the ritual and what it seeks to accomplish. I don't need to tell you the menace three swords like Tcharfing will pose in the hands of heretics, nor the threat of a sword greater still.

“Elser has fled to the Middle Bridge, where he enjoys the protection of mutant cultists. They have begun using the old loading cranes to lower sorcerous totems into the River Stir, no doubt to spread the blight of Mordheim. My scouts claim the very waters boil as these foul artefacts sink into them and a black stream of corruption can be seen slithering away with the current.

“Brothers, these heretics must be stopped! Bring to them the wrath of Sigmar! Destroy their foul totems and subdue Elser that he may yet submit to Sigmar's justice!”",
    "2324860394" : "“Under the attentions of the torturers from Altdorf, Elser has revealed all that he knows about Tcharfing and the other Chaos blades. He was most reluctant to part with the information, but after several days of being put to the question he at last understood the futility of defying the will of Sigmar. The greater the heresy the more reluctant they are to confess their crimes.

“Tcharfing is not, as I thought, the same blade, but a new sword crafted to house the daemon bound within the original. By cunning artifice the master smith who served Count Steinhardt created an exact replica of Tcharfing as described in the Daemonomicon. He did this under the control of an Alluress, a daemon handmaiden of Slaanesh. With the sorcery of Elser, a cult magister and a renegade warlock, they were able to translocate the daemon from the original blade into their replica. They repeated this process for each of the swords. The Alluress then seduced her favourite champions from the warbands prowling Mordheim and gifted them with these blades.

“The sword dedicated to Khorne was fashioned after Bloodeater, the murderous weapon of the monstrous Tong chieftains. The Chaos champion the Alluress bestowed it upon was killed by Reiker's Reavers, a mercenary company based in the old Raven Barracks. Reiker himself claimed Bloodeater as a trophy and bore it back to their base.

“Brother, we cannot allow the sword to remain at liberty. We must attack the Barracks, take the sword, and kill Reiker. My scouts say a mutant ogre has joined Reiker and they have erected a profane altar to Khorne.

“I am minded that the holy blade Griffonbrand was once kept in the Raven Barracks. If it is still there, it would make a potent weapon against the powers of Chaos. Be vigilant and perhaps you can find its hiding place.”",
    "3052990188" : "“By the grace of Sigmar, my scouts have found the third sword and been fortunate enough to survive their discovery. The blade Wormbringer is in the possession of Ernst Streicher, a magister of the Cult of the Possessed. This heretic madman thinks to master the polluted sword of Nurgle, in his arrogance believing himself wilful enough to withstand the contagion of the Plague God and all infected with his diseased power. 

“Streicher has used Wormbringer to gain control of a ferocious beast, a survivor from Count Steinhardt's menagerie. For some time the old Market Square has been haunted by this monster, but it was content to simply sate its hunger and defend its territory. Now, under the profane control of Streicher it ranges over the whole district, slaughtering whoever its master sends it against. No warband has proven strong enough to fight off this murderous creature.

“We are fortunate enough to know the nature of our enemy and the secret of its malignance. The bestiaries of Altdorf record the beast as a manticore, a leonine horror from the darkest wilds. In addition to its mighty claws and fangs, it possesses a deadly sting in its tail. To these natural weaponries we must take into account the unnatural powers of Streicher and the sword. The taint of Nurgle will have saturated the whole of the square, defiling all in a morass of corruption. Resisting the diseased influence of the Plague God may prove as much a threat as the manticore and its master.

“It is vital that Wormbringer be captured. This abomination cannot be allowed to work still greater evil. Both Streicher and the manticore he has enslaved must be killed. The Market Square must be cleansed of the corruption that infests it. By sword and by fire, let the will of Sigmar be done!”",
    "3103323045" : "“Altdorf has sent word back to me. The Grand Theogonist has uncovered a rite by which these Chaos relics can be purified and the daemons within them exorcised. The ritual requires certain holy relics to assist in its efficacy. Providentially these relics were housed in Mordheim's Temple of Sigmar. If they still exist, then they are within your reach, brother.

“I say 'if they exist' because the temple has long fallen into ruin and been pillaged by mercenary looters and the creatures of Chaos alike. For a time the Sisters of Sigmar made a pretence of defending the site, perhaps seeking to convince the Grand Theogonist of their continuing piety. I cannot say if their motives were sincere, but I do know that the last warband of Sisters posted to defend the temple have been corrupted. In their weakness, they were seduced by the call of Chaos. 

“My scouts bring word that these heretic Sisters yet linger in the ruins, defiling the sacred halls they swore to protect. They consort with daemons and their matriarch bears Mournmock, the blade of Slaanesh. 

“There is no more despicable a creature than a blasphemer. Scourge your heart of pity, for these women defile the name of our god. They are lost to His light forever. You must be as ruthless with them as with any other creature of Chaos. Only by destroying these heretics can we hope to recover the relics that can break the power of Elser's swords.

“We will reclaim the Temple of Sigmar. Destroy the daemons that infest it, reconsecrate the sacred statues and recover the holy relic. If the font hasn't been despoiled, you may be able to remove some of its holy water to aid you in your battles. Most importantly, Mounrmock must be captured and the woman who bears it dispatched to Sigmar for His final judgement.”",
    "3086545426" : "“Hasten! We must be swift! My scouts report that the foul sorceress Merga Ottweiler is performing an obscene rite at the base of Count Gotthardt's Statue. Merga was a powerful sorceress already, but I am told she is now in possession of Shadowbrand. Either she was given it by the Alluress or stole it from the one who is immaterial. We cannot allow this fiend to keep such an unholy artefact and draw upon its powers!

“Merga's cultist followers have raised a circle of monoliths around Count Gotthardt's statue. I fear  can guess what she intends to do. She is seeking to open a gateway directly to the Realm of Chaos and to syphon aethryic energies directly from their source! Such a conjuration would send a surge of rampant magic sweeping across the city, twisting and mutating everything in its path. Daemons would seep into our world, sustain by the energies escaping from the gateway. The corruption unleashed by this single act might be such that it could never be cleansed.

“There! Ahead of us! The monoliths, behold the foul symbols with which they are defaced and the fell glow that surrounds them. You must cast them down and break the arcane circle Merga has fashioned to fuel her rites. Beware, for the sorceress herself cannot be far away! 

“Wait! There are strange energies here. More of the totems! And what is this? Shapes rushing out from the darkness! Masked cultists and disfigured mutants! All around us!

“Sigmar protect us, we are trapped! It is an ambush!”",
    "3002657331" : "“Glory to Sigmar, the Grand Theogonist sends word that the method for destroying the swords has been discovered!

“The cursed blades must be taken back to the place where they were crafted and broken with the same tools used to give them shape. This alone isn't enough, however. The members of the cabal that forged them and translocated the daemons into them must also be slain. Alive they will act as a link between the blades and the mortal world. Only their deaths can sever the link.

“The Alluress who orchestrated this plot has made the ballroom of Count Steinhardt's Palace her lair. She holds court there with an entourage of daemonettes and slaves she's enthralled with her enchantments. Don't underestimate her powers, for she was able to ensnare the Sisters of Sigmar defending the temple. Beside her, the warlock and magister who helped create the swords are certain to still be around. Their facility with the black arts must be prodigious indeed to fabricate such unholy things.

“During his interrogation, Elser confessed that the swords were forged in the palace smithy. Using the relic you recovered from the Temple of Sigmar, we can purify the place and make it ready for the cleansing ritual. Once the Alluress and her aides have been dealt with, you will need to use the same hammer that shaped the swords to break them. The Alluress will have kept the tool close, aware of the threat it could pose if unguarded.

“The end is upon us, brother! It is my honour to fight at your side once more against those who would defile and profane the lands given to man by holy Sigmar! Let us pray He will speed us to victory!”",

Amid the desolation and destruction wrought by the Hammer of Sigmar upon decadent Mordheim, one place alone survived unharmed: the Rock, the island fortress-convent of the Sisters of Sigmar.

In ganz Mortheim hat nur ein Ort die von dem Hammer des Sigmar verursachte Verwüstung schadlos überstanden: der Felsen – eine Insel, auf der die Klosterfestung der Schwestern des Sigmar liegt.

non-breaking space before ellipsis in DE translation
This miraculous survival has emboldened the Sisters, spurring their devotion to their god to a new intensity of fervour.

Ermutigt durch diese wundersame Rettung dienen die Schwestern ihrem Gott noch hingebungsvoller ...
